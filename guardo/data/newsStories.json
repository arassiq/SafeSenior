    "content": "The story behind “McMillions” is as delicious as a thick juicy burger. Yet like the criminal scheme at its core, the HBO documentary inspired by it proves a little too cute and clever for its own good. Leisurely spread over six parts – an increasingly common practice as pay services capitalize on their available shelf space – the project focuses on the 2001 scheme that rigged the McDonald’s Monopoly game, with an insider distributing winning pieces and garnering most of the loot. “How in the world could this have happened?” Rob Holm, director of global security for McDonald’s, recalls thinking when he learned of the plot. The company found out about the breach from the FBI, which launched an elaborate undercover operation, catching the not-very-bright participants in fantastic lies. The sting went so far as to shoot mock “I’m a winner!” commercials, exposing a rogues’ gallery that appears to have been plucked out of a Coen brothers movie. It’s a story, frankly, that doesn’t need much embellishment – an exercise in greed run amok. But the use of cheesy reenactments to flesh out the story, coupled with the giddiness of some interviewees, inject a little too much showbiz pizzazz into the proceedings. For one, FBI special agent Doug Mathews – a self-professed ham, who orchestrated the undercover portion of the investigation – seems as if he’s auditioning for his own TV show. Others insist that the whole thing was serious business, but there’s a lot of giggling as they reminisce at the expense of those caught up in the bureau’s web. The mastermind was Jerry Jacobson, a former cop working as a security officer who did work for the company that printed the game pieces. He is, essentially, the heart of the story, which encompasses a strange assortment of peculiar characters, including one who converted his strip club into what he called a church in order to skirt local zoning ordinances. Produced by Mark Wahlberg’s company, “McMillions” is of course a cautionary tale, a reminder to be wary of both get-rich-quick offers and stories that look and sound too good to be true. For all that, having viewed three of its six parts, the documentary feels like a bit of overkill – in a not-everything-is-“The Jinx,” or “Making a Murderer,” kind of way. Think of it as further proof that in this age where true-crime TV is as abundant as fast-food restaurants, it’s possible to serve too much of a good thing. “McMillions” premieres Feb. 3 at 10 p.m. on HBO. Like CNN, HBO is a unit of WarnerMedia. ",

    "content": "Two New Jersey men are facing charges of running a 9/11 memorial scam allegedly by collecting donations and selling memorial T-shirts from the back of a pickup truck painted with the World Trade Center towers, according to the state attorney general’s office. Mark Niemczyk, 66, of Tinton Falls, and Thomas Scalgione, 41, of Manahawkin, allegedly sold T-shirts and collected donations out of their truck at 9/11 events from June 2010 until July 2012. according to a statement from the New Jersey attorney general. They displayed a sign that read “All donations for the T-shirts go to families of 9/11,” but none of the more than $50,000 raised was sent to the victims’ families or 9/11 charities. Both men were indicted Monday on third-degree charges of conspiracy and two counts of theft by deception, according to the statement. Niemczyk was also charged with failure to file a personal state income tax return in 2011, and for failing to report thousands of dollars in proceeds from the 9/11 T-shirt sales and donations and other money he had won at a casino. One count of theft by deception refers to the sale of T-shirts and collection of donations, and the second refers to the purchase of the T-shirts at a discounted rate by posing as a charity. The indictment did not specify a court date, and it could not be determined whether the men had retained attorneys. New Jersey in July 2011 filed suit against Niemczyk and Scalgione, alleging they defrauded donors. They were ordered to pay back $121,116 in donations and to pay civil penalties. They were also permanently barred from working for any charitable organization in New Jersey. The pair allegedly claimed they were father-and-son firefighters who were working at a firehouse near the World Trade Center on 9/11, Director Elie Honig of the state Division of Criminal Justice said in the statement.  “Their conduct was outrageous, and we urge any victims who donated money or bought T-shirts from these con artists to contact us,” Honig said in the statement. According to the state attorney general’s statement, the truck used by the men was painted with the names of police and firefighters who died on September 11, 2001. Rosemary Cain, mother of firefighter George McCain, who was killed, felt betrayed when she learned her son’s name was being used as a part of the scam.  “I feel that he’s dishonored the 343 firefighters, he’s dishonored by putting their names on a truck and using it to scam people of their money,” she told CNN affiliate WCBS, referring to the defendants. “Absolutely it’s a betrayal, it’s disgusting.” The two men purchased hundreds of T-shirts with 9/11 themes printed on them from two vendors. The vendors charged between $3 and $6.90 per shirt, which Niemczyk and Scaglione then sold for $20 apiece, according to the state attorney general’s office. “The conduct of these two men wasn’t just despicable,” Attorney General Jeffrey Chiesa said.  “It was criminal, and we are bringing them to justice.” Scalgione was the alleged “public relations” part of the team, making arrangements to set up their truck at different 9/11 events, authorities said. The men were not registered with the state of New Jersey as a charitable organization as required by law. If convicted, Niemczyk and Scalgione could each face three to five years in prison.

    "content": "In the largest alleged BP oil spill-related scam uncovered to date, federal authorities on Thursday charged two Floridians with taking $340,000 in funds intended for victims of last year’s environmental disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. Justice Department officials said Joseph Harvey, 51, and Anja Kannell, 41, of Delray Beach, Florida, appeared in federal court in Miami on Thursday to face indictments for mail fraud, wire fraud and aggressive identity theft. Prosecutors said the defendants claimed the money from a $20 billion fund set up to help legitimate victims of the spill recover lost income. Justice officials said they have brought charges in at least 30 cases in which individuals tried to recover funds to which they were not entitled. This was the biggest case yet, according to the Justice Department.  Harvey and Kannell are accused of filing phony claims using 34 assumed identities of actual Florida residents.  These claims were complete with names and Social Security numbers, though they had fictitious addresses in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle. Officials say the defendants instructed that all the funds be sent to an account they controlled in Texas.  A magistrate judge on Thursday ordered Harvey and Kannell to remain in custody, pending further court proceedings next week.  The charges carry 10-, 15- and 20-year prison sentences upon conviction.

    "content": "Google failed to stop a network of predatory websites from buying ads to promote “scam” fishing licenses to people across the country even after multiple state agencies repeatedly complained to the company about the ads, those states told CNN Business.  After being contacted by CNN Business, Google conducted an internal investigation and confirmed that it did receive reports from two state agencies. The company is now looking into why the ads were not removed from its platform following those reports.  CNN Business found at least 31 suspect websites targeting people looking to buy fishing licenses in 14 states: California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin. Agencies from multiple states, including Tennessee, California and New York, characterized the websites to CNN Business as either being a “scam” or “fraudulent.” The states say they have no idea who is behind the sites or if it is a ploy to harvest confidential and sensitive information — ID numbers, social security numbers, even physical attributes — from victims. Some of the sites charge double and triple the cost of an actual fishing license sold by the state. In tests, CNN Business found ads on Google\n            \n                (GOOGL) targeting people in 11 states, which put the sites at the top of search results for fishing licenses, potentially boosting their reach significantly. Three states —Texas, Pennsylvania and New York —told CNN Business they complained, multiple times in some cases, to Google\n            \n                (GOOGL) about the ads as far back as mid-2019, but the company never acted on those warnings. One state, Texas, said Google\n            \n                (GOOGL) responded to its first complaint by concluding it did not consider the sites targeting Texans to be fraudulent. “Unfortunately, Google disagreed with our pleas and has allowed it to continue showing up as a paid ad on search results for information on Texas fishing licenses,” Texas Parks and Wildlife communications director Josh Havens told CNN Business. “We have strict policies against ads that mislead users by implying an affiliation with a government agency,” a Google spokesperson told CNN Business in a statement. “We have removed the violating ads and took the appropriate action on the accounts. We are continuing to investigate this matter and looking at ways to better work with state agencies to address these issues in real-time.” Google took the ads down several hours after CNN Business asked the company for comment. It’s unknown how many people were victims of the alleged scam, or even exposed to it. Google declined to share how many people viewed or clicked on the ads.  The sites’ long-running use of Google ads, and the criticisms of Google’s response to it, highlight the challenges that big tech companies continue to face in spotting and preventing bad actors from taking advantage of their platforms given their staggering scale, with billions of users and pieces of content to monitor. More than that, it shows how powerless concerned individuals can feel when trying to get the attention of big tech companies and push for fixes – even when they are law enforcement personnel from state agencies. A Google spokesperson said the ads were removed because the company believes the sites were using dishonest business practices. Google has also permanently suspended the two separate Google Advertising accounts that bought the ads for some of the sites.   Struggling to get the attention of a tech giant  After officials at Texas Parks and Wildlife saw the fishing ads in June 2019, they said they tried multiple strategies to get Google’s attention.  First, Texas officials said they filed a complaint through Google’s Advertising Legal Support Team. The Texas officials noted the sites were counterfeit, potentially harvesting personal information like social security numbers. “The response we received from Google’s Legal Support Team said that our complaint does not pertain to the sale or promotion for sale of counterfeit goods and that they will not be taking further action,” Havens told CNN Business.  Next, officials reported the sites to Google as a scammer. Havens said they got an “auto-response from Google saying that they would look into it.” But nothing happened.  Google didn’t respond to a question on whether Texas notified it in an appropriate way. A spokesperson told CNN Business that it investigates every report of fraudulent ads.  CNN Business repeatedly reached out to emails associated with the fishing sites as well as to the server company hosting them, but did not receive any response.  For state officials like those at Texas Parks and Wildlife, the stakes are high. Google’s search engine is the gateway into the internet for many. It’s where we turn to find seemingly reliable and relevant results about fishing licenses, as well as restaurants, travel, ailments and more. Nearly 93% of all internet search traffic in the world in December came from Google Search, according to Web traffic analytics company StatCounter. But Google algorithms are not the only force behind what people see.  When CNN Business found the websites in the top position above Google searches for fishing licenses in 11 of the 14 states, it was because someone paid Google for these sites to sit in that top spot.  Google’s advertising platform, which accounts for the vast majority of its overall business, allows companies to “get in front of customers” with more prominent placement in results than they might otherwise receive, according to the company’s own description. The company clearly labels these sponsored results as ads, but they are otherwise identical to how actual search results appear —potentially making it easier for bad actors to trick people. In 2018, Google removed 2.3 billion of what it calls “bad ads” worldwide and removed more than 1 million advertising accounts, according to the company. It is still compiling numbers for 2019. Recognizing the risks these ads posed to their residents, some states went on the offensive. Tennessee put roughly $2,000 of taxpayer money each month into Google’s ad auctions to outbid scam sites like these, in hopes of getting the top ad spot. It didn’t work; the account buying ads for the scam site was most likely putting even more money into their ads. “Many times these sites will outbid us for these search words to a point where it is not fiscally responsible for us to continue to pay for certain keywords,” said Jenifer Wisniewski, head of communications for the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency. She added that Tennessee, like “many states,” has taken this approach. (CNN Business has not independently confirmed whether other states have in fact done so.) In short: as long as scammers continue to buy ads on Google, state agencies may feel they have little choice but to use taxpayer funds to try to outbid the bad actors. Google had no comment on Tennessee’s effort to knock the ads from the top spot with taxpayer funds. Turning to other authorities for help It’s impossible to determine how many people — potentially as a result of Google ads — were duped into giving their money and confidential information to the websites for what they believed were fishing licenses.     When CNN Business compared what the websites charged for what they said were fishing licenses, it was almost always double or triple the amount each state charged for authentic licenses. Georgia, for example, charges non-residents $50 for a one-year fishing license whereas the alleged scam sites charged $150. The payments on the sites were processed by online payments processing company Stripe. The company told CNN Business that 12 of the websites used or attempted to use its payment processing platform. It removed all of the sites from being able to process payments between 2018 and 2019.   “Stripe is continually monitoring for fraudulent merchants and transactions on our platform, and we immediately remove any merchants engaging in illegal activity,” the company said in a statement to CNN Business. “We are investigating whether there are any other merchants/websites who might be connected to these and are still using Stripe. So far, we haven’t identified any.” California, New York and Tennessee told CNN Business they have now contacted the FBI about the websites. CNN Business asked the FBI if the websites were under investigation but the agency declined to comment and would not confirm or deny the existence of an investigation, citing Department of Justice policy. Every state impacted tells CNN the sites have no authorization to sell fishing licenses and that the only way to buy fishing licenses online is through the official state agency sites.  A number of websites are still active. While Google has the power to crack down on the ads, it is not responsible for the websites.",

    "content": "A priest at the center of an illegal baby adoption scam in Chile has been moved out of the country and faces no charges, even after admitting he participated in at least two illegal adoptions. The Rev. Gerardo Joannon, who belongs to the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts order, has been relocated to a house for priests in the city of Merlo, Argentina. The transfer is supposed to be “an act of religious obedience” and a time to pray and serve penance, according to a statement issued by the order. The statement does not give a reason for his penance. Joannon, who is in his late 70s, publicly admitted last year that he had facilitated illegal adoptions during the 1970s and ’80s. According to the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts order and Chilean authorities, the priest took at least two babies from their biological mothers, either through lies or coercion, and in secret gave them to adoptive families. Mario Carroza, a prosecutor who investigated the case, said upper-class families would approach Joannon after learning an unmarried daughter was pregnant. He said the priest would then conspire with doctors, nurses, nuns and others to deliver the baby, which would then be raised by the adoptive parents. “We’re talking about crimes like kidnapping, of course, because the baby was taken from the mother without her consent or knowledge; falsification of identity, because the baby was made to appear as a biological child of a different couple, and falsification of documents,” Carroza said. Carroza, though, has ruled the statute of limitations has run out, and that the priest could no longer be prosecuted, angering those still looking for biological parents and children. Read how one one mother and son were reunited The ruling has also puzzled many Chileans who are also questioning the decision to send the priest to Argentina. CNN tried to get a more elaborate answer from the order, but an interview request was declined.  At the house where the priest used to live, another priest hung up the intercom after being asked about Joannon. The leader of the order, the Rev. Alex Vigueras, was also not answering questions when he arrived at his home. He said “we’re not giving any interviews” and quickly drove in and closed the gate. The Congregation of the Sacred Hearts order conducted an internal investigation last year into the allegations and sent its findings to the Vatican. The Holy See later determined that even though the priest had made ethical and moral mistakes, none of his actions had risen to the level of a violation of canon law. Carroza, the prosecutor who handled the case, said the investigation is still open and, as more cases surface, he is hoping there will be a case he can prosecute. Joannon’s attorney, Eduardo Novoa, said the crimes his client is accused of were not even on the books until 1988. “My client, as priest, knew families and would approach them with the intention of giving them support and guidance when unexpected pregnancies occurred,” he said. “In some cases, the grandparents or parents of a young, pregnant woman considered the pregnancy unacceptable and would seek to give the baby away so that another family would raise him as their child.” Chilean authorities said Joannon is only one of many priests, nuns, doctors, nurses and others who conspired to carry out illegal adoptions during the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet between 1973 and 1990. The number of stolen children, officials interviewed by CNN said, could be in the thousands. In Chile, they’re known as the “Children of Silence.” Gloria Cortés, 63, says she gave birth to a healthy baby on March 4, 1976, only to be told hours later the boy had died. “I gave birth to that baby and they yanked him away from my very arms,” Cortés said.  “How can there be such bad people in this world?” She was never shown a body or a death certificate.  The hospital where she gave birth shut down years ago.  Documents that could prove her story were lost over the years. Constanza del Río, 42, a Santiago graphic designer, is looking for her biological parents.  Her adoptive parents told her they picked her up as a newborn in a Santiago clinic. The Carolina Freire Clinic shut down many years ago and the building is abandoned and in ruins. Del Río said she feels like a part of her will be missing until she finds her biological mother and the truth about her past. “I don’t want to change my name or change my family. I just want to know who she was and how this happened,” del Río said. With the support of her husband, del Río launched a website last year to help connect the “Children of Silence” with their biological parents. But the process has been frustrating, del Río said. They’re struggling for money to create a DNA database that would help the process of reconnecting families. They also feel the government is dragging its feet. They feel a successful prosecution against Joannon would have opened the door for other cases. The ruling against moving forward with the case was a big disappointment, they said. Some of those responsible for the adoptions, from doctors to priests and nurses, have died over the years.  With Joannon now in Argentina, many of the families caught in the scandal fear they may never get justice or the truth about the children of silence.",

    "content": "Americans instantly zip billions of dollars a day to each other on Zelle and other payment apps to do everything from pay the babysitter to split restaurant bills. The speed and convenience of these payment platforms have simultaneously made them insanely popular and a magnet for con artists posing as dog breeders, ticket sellers, government agencies or other legitimate services. Consumers reported losing $210 million to fraudsters on payment apps and services in 2023 alone, 62% more than two years ago, according to federal data. Bank transfer or payment fraud losses spiked by nearly 150% over that span to $1.9 billion. Yet it’s often very difficult for consumers to retrieve money sent to bad guys. The big banks that run Zelle in particular “rarely” reimburse customers duped by scammers, according to a recent Senate investigation. So Democrats in Congress are introducing new legislation that would seek to crack down on payment scams by closing loopholes in existing law. It faces potential banking industry opposition and uncertain prospects of passing a Republican-controlled House. The bills, sponsored by Rep. Maxine Waters in the House and Sens. Richard Blumenthal and Elizabeth Warren in their chamber, would protect consumers who are defrauded when they make payments to scam artists on Zelle, Venmo and other platforms. The Senate bill was introduced Thursday and the House bill is set to be introduced later on Friday, the bill’s supporters say. ‘Recipe for disaster’ The legislation would apply to all peer-to-peer platforms, though the focus of recent hearings and reports has been Zelle, the biggest player in the fast-growing space. “Right now, most Zelle transactions are instantaneous and irreversible – which is a recipe for disaster,” Blumenthal told CNN in a phone interview. “Zelle and the big banks who own it know that this speed and convenience make consumers a target for con artists who dupe them out of hard-earned money.” Consumers and small businesses sent $806 billion of payments on Zelle last year alone, 28% more than in 2022. Zelle said Americans sent an average of more than $100 million an hour on the platform by the end of last year. Yet just 12% of consumers last year were reimbursed for Zelle payments disputed as scams, according to the investigation released last week by the Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which is chaired by Blumenthal. JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Bank of America rejected a combined total of $560 million of scam disputes between 2021 and 2023, the report found. Scamming victims out of luck One problem is that existing law does not explicitly require banks to reimburse customers who authorize transactions induced by bad actors. That means customers duped into sending money to con artists are often out of luck. For instance, Zelle says that while customers hurt by unauthorized activity are “typically” able to get their money back, victims of scams may not. “Even if you were tricked or persuaded into authorizing a payment for a good or service someone said they were going to provide, but they didn’t fulfill it, this would be considered a scam,” Zelle says on its website. “Because you authorized the payment, you may not be able to get your money back.” Ariana Duval, a rising senior at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, received an email this spring with an opportunity to participate in a research project. The scammer posed as an actual research professor at Duval’s school, someone her friends had worked before. Ultimately, the fraudsters convinced Duval, a 21-year-old majoring in fashion merchandise and design, to transfer $2,400 over Zelle to buy research supplies. They even emailed her a mobile check to cover the expenses – a check that turned out to be bogus. “I felt really stupid. Normally, I look at myself as someone who is levelheaded, but in this case I fell for it,” Duval told CNN in a phone interview. Duval, who testified before Congress, tried and failed to get Zelle to refund her the money she lost during the scheme, which also claimed other students as victims. “It was scary. And it can happen at any point to anyone,” Duval said. The Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978 (EFTA) only protects customers from unauthorized transfers, such as when a credit card is stolen. The new legislation would seek to close loopholes in the EFTA, protecting consumers from liability when they are defrauded into authorizing a transfer to scammers. The bill would also eliminate an exemption for bank wire transfers and allow the banks of victims to get reimbursed by the banks receiving the fraudulent funds. In a statement, Zelle spokesperson Eric Blankenbaker told CNN that executives are “reviewing the details” of the proposed legislation and stressed that the payment platform has “provided financial empowerment for millions of Americans” and led the industry in scam reimbursement efforts. “We are committed to protecting consumers through highly effective fraud and scam countermeasures,” Blankenbaker said. “Criminals who perpetrate the fraud and scams are the ultimate source of the problem and stopping the root cause of financial fraud and scams requires solutions like increased law enforcement resources and criminal penalties, consumer education and preventing criminals from spoofing identities.” While Zelle doesn’t offer payment protection, some of its rivals do. For instance, both Venmo and PayPal have purchase protection options for when customers send money to sellers they don’t know. Zelle refund policy During a hearing last week, Zelle’s backers defended the platform and stated that more than 99.9% of all transactions are completed without any reports of fraud or scams. Cameron Fowler, CEO of Zelle owner Early Warning Services (EWS), told lawmakers in prepared remarks that reports of fraud and scam payments processed on the platform fell last year even as overall transactions surged. “EWS remains steadfastly committed to protecting Zelle users from fraud and scams, through an extensive array of highly effective fraud and scam countermeasures,” Fowler said. Under pressure from lawmakers, last year banks on Zelle began refunding some victims of imposter scams. Fowler said Zelle requires reimbursements for the victims of “qualifying imposter scams where the consumer was duped into sending money to a criminal posing as a government agency, financial institution or service provider.” Blumenthal, the Connecticut Democrat said he’s “very hopeful” his bill will get bipartisan support because “there is nothing red or blue about this.” However, he acknowledges big banks may try to kill it. “I’m pretty clear-eyed about the industry’s position,” Blumenthal said. “The right thing to do would be to support this legislation, but I don’t anticipate a favorable response.”",

    "content": "The holidays are the perfect time for shoppers to hunt for a good deal. It’s also a prime opportunity for bad actors to scam consumers. Hundreds of malicious Black Friday apps and websites will be looking to steal personal data and credit card information this year in the United States and United Kingdom, according to a new report from cybersecurity company RiskIQ.  Cybercriminals create fake mobile apps and landing pages with realistic branding, especially around major holidays and events like Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday. They want to convince consumers to download bad apps or visit bogus sites and ultimately “phish” for sensitive data.  A scam circulating on popular messaging platform WhatsApp ahead of Black Friday promises 99%-off discounts on Amazon.com. On Twitter, Amazon’s official help account wrote: “Please don’t share your order/account/personal details in such websites.” Consumers are especially vulnerable when shopping on smartphones.  Mobile browsers have a much shorter address field, and consumers may not see the full URL on their phone. This makes it harder to spot a scam. According to marketing firm Criteo, over 40% of all sales in November and December 2017 were made on mobile phones, and the trend is only expected to grow. Steve Ginty, senior product manager at RiskIQ, says to check that the website has a valid “HTTPS” connection with a lock symbol, not “HTTP,” which is vulnerable to attacks.  Users should also be careful when downloading apps. Bogus holiday deal apps made by scammers can fool users into typing in their credit card information, while other apps feature malware that can steal personal data or lock a smartphone until the user pays a ransom fee.  According to RiskIQ’s recent report, 5.5% out of the 4,324 Black Friday-related apps on global app stores are deemed malicious and unsafe, and 4.6% of Cyber Monday apps are malicious. The firm recommends scrutinizing who developed the app, and only downloading apps from official app stores like Apple and Google.  Yair Levy, a cybersecutity and information systems expert at Nova Southeastern University, says to only shop with retailers you trust.  “Don’t try to look for offers that are too good to be true. At the end of the day, that’s what they are,” he said.  Levy also suggests having a credit card dedicated to online shopping. This makes it easier to track purchases and identify fraudulent activity.  Shoppers should be wary of email deals, too. Phishing emails can look similar to those sent by top retailers, and consumers should ignore or delete these emails, no matter how good a deal seems. Cybersecurity company BullGuard says the aim of these fraudsters is to get consumers to click on a link within the email, and enter their personal information.  Some experts anticipate more scam activity this holiday season than last year. “Every year we see this growing significantly,” said Levy. “Why? Because it becomes more successful. Every year more people shop online.” ",

    "content": "Patrick Giblin was like the American version of the “Tinder Swindler” – but without the private jets.  He wooed women with stories about his respectable family – his father was a judge, he said – and beachfront property in Atlantic City, New Jersey, where he said he worked in the casino industry, according to a federal criminal complaint. He told them he was ready to settle down and was more interested in a woman’s inner beauty than her outward appearance.  He vowed that distance was not an issue because he had access to discount flights and was even ready to move to a woman’s city to further their romance.  But federal officials say those were all lies, concocted to swindle women looking for love through dating sites. A review of plea agreements and federal complaints show that Giblin conned at least 100 women over two decades, coaxing them out of more than $250,000 with false promises followed by requests for short-term loans that were never repaid. “He preyed on vulnerabilities, promising to end the loneliness of a woman who had recently ended a long-term relationship or soothing someone who recently suffered the death of a loved one,” said a report by federal prosecutors in New Jersey. “Giblin would convince these women that he was willing to relocate to their locales but needed money wired to do so.”  Despite convictions and serving prison time, he continued to defraud women, even after he was caught and twice escaped from federal custody.  Prosecutors say Giblin even scammed women from prison while he was serving time on similar charges, and after he became a fugitive for failing to show up at a halfway house in Newark, New Jersey. But his schemes may finally be over. On Wednesday a federal judge sentenced Giblin to 66 months in prison for escaping from federal custody and one count of wire fraud for engaging in a scheme to defraud women over telephone dating services.  His cons predated Tinder and other dating apps Giblin’s scams date as far back as the early 2000s, authorities said – back when he was in his thirties, and long before Tinder, Bumble and other dating apps. He’s now 58.   On Lavalife, QuestChat and other dating services, Giblin went by “Pat,” a seemingly charismatic man who assured women that their weight, height and other physical features were not an issue, according to the federal criminal complaint. The complaint said he created numerous accounts in his name on dating sites in the United States and Canada.   Prosecutors say he’d message women on the sites, tell them he was seeking a long-term relationship with a “real, true, genuine woman,” and exchange phone numbers. Giblin would then build a rapport with the women over long phone conversations before he started asking them for money, court documents said.  He gave them various excuses for financial emergencies, including that his car broke down or that he needed funds to free up winnings from a gambling tournament, court documents said.   His scams predated Venmo, Zelle and other payment apps, so he asked the women to wire him cash – usually several hundred dollars at a time – through MoneyGram or Western Union. Some of the women didn’t know how to use the wire services, but he’d talk them through the process, federal court documents said.   Prosecutors say Giblin targeted vulnerable women, including widows, women with physical disabilities and single mothers – including at least one who had recently lost a child.  “Giblin went after the lonely, and broken hearted. Figured out their soft spots and attacked those when he didn’t get his money,” Kathy Waters, executive director of Advocating Against Romance Scammers, told CNN. “The victims are not only abused financially, but emotionally and psychologically as well. He is a master manipulator who has scammed an unknown amount of people, since some never come forward.” Giblin’s public defender, Lori Koch, declined to comment when reached by CNN.   He was first arrested in 2005 for scamming a woman in Ohio Giblin’s scams were first exposed after he was charged with one count of extortion in New Jersey for allegedly scamming a woman in Ohio.  That was in March 2005.  After his arrest, the FBI said he’d used the same telephone dating services to con women nationwide for five years prior to that, court documents show. At the time, Giblin admitted that over a five-year period he had victimized more than 80 women, according to a federal report. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 115 months in prison.  But that was just the beginning. Waters believes his number of victims is likely much higher because Giblin continued defrauding women on and off until 2021, and some victims of romance scammers are too embarrassed to come forward.  “The amount of romance scam victims Giblin violated in the US over the years is a number we’ve never seen tied to one scammer,” Waters said. “Not reporting the crime is common for those who have been romance scammed. Often times scrutiny goes along with reporting, which leads to shame and embarrassment.” To avoid getting the women mixed up, Giblin kept detailed notes of his activity on the dating services, including names of the victims, their physical descriptions, what they did for a living  and the type of man they were looking for, according to the criminal complaint.  The FBI interviewed numerous women who disclosed that they’d wired him money.  As part of a plea deal, Giblin admitted that he’d stolen more than $200,000 from women over the years. In April 2007, he pleaded guilty to wire fraud and was sentenced to more than nine years in prison.  He was sent to a federal prison in Greenville, Illinois. But his criminal activity didn’t stop.   He escaped from federal custody in 2012 In late 2012 federal officials placed Giblin in a residential reentry program in Philadelphia. There, he was given a day pass to find a job in Atlantic City, but he never returned and became a fugitive, according to the criminal complaint. A few weeks later, federal authorities found him in an  Atlantic City hotel, gambling away funds from women he’d scammed from telephone dating services while on the lam, according to court documents. He’d checked into the hotel under an alias, “Michael Patrick.” A federal agent asked Giblin where he got the $711 in his possession and if he’d received money from women, and he responded, “there’s one chick I have been f**king around with.” But a search of his hotel room revealed there was more than one woman.  Investigators recovered a cellphone, money transfer receipts and notebooks containing a treasure trove of information, including physical descriptions, interests and hobbies of women he interacted with on dating sites while he was on the lam. The women were from all over the country, including Wisconsin, Minnesota, South Carolina, New York and Ohio.  In his notes about one woman, Giblin wrote, “has a savings Account. Home is paid for not a golddigger,” federal documents said. He pleaded guilty to escape charges and was sentenced to 18 months in prison.  In December 2013 he was freed from prison again, this time to start supervised release in New Jersey,  federal documents said. As a condition his release, Giblin was to notify his probation officer of any plans to leave the state, but a federal agent later arrested him at a hotel in Colonie, New York.  While in New York, Giblin used dating sites to meet and defraud more than 10 women of  between $15,000 and $40,000, court documents said. Eight years later, he escaped again Giblin was convicted and sentenced in August 2017 to five years in prison and ordered to pay tens of thousands of dollars in restitution. But he continued to scam women while incarcerated at federal prisons in Estill, South Carolina, and in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, court records said.  In July 2020, he was approved to be transferred from the prison in Lewisburg to a residential reentry center in Newark. Federal officials say they escorted him onto a plane at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Giblin’s itinerary included a layover in Charlotte. He never emerged in Newark.  While on the run, Giblin posted messages on telephone dating services and continued scamming and receiving money from women, federal documents said. Prosecutors say that between 2019 and 2021 he defrauded about a dozen women out of more than $37,000. He was arrested in March of 2021 in Atlantic City and pleaded guilty in July this year to wire fraud and escaping from federal custody. In addition to his sentence this week of 66 months in prison, Giblin was given three years of supervised release and ordered to pay restitution of $23,428.  Waters, the advocate for romance scam victims, said she doesn’t think the sentence was harsh enough considering the breadth of Giblin’s crimes – and just gives him time to plan more ways to scam women. “Unfortunately the counts didn’t include every life he caused harm to,” she told CNN. “It takes years to heal emotionally, psychologically and financially from these scammers.” ",

    "content": "Hop to it! A new study shows higher levels of physical activity at any intensity lowers the risk of early death in middle-age and older people.  Here’s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. (You can also get “5 Things You Need to Know Today” delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Ex-Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, the CEO of online discount retailer Overstock, resigned yesterday after publishing a news release this week titled, “Comments on Deep State.” In it, Byrne claimed he helped the FBI carry out “political espionage” and referred an undefined entity called the “Men in Black.” Unsurprisingly, Overstock shares plummeted after the bizarre missive, but just because Byrne is out doesn’t mean he’s done talking. After his departure, the ex-CEO appeared on CNN and said the FBI directed him to pursue a “romantic relationship with Maria Butina” in the summer before the 2016 election. Butina is the Russian woman who has been accused of seeking to win influence in powerful Republican circles at the direction of her country’s government. None of this has been verified, and former FBI Director James Comey told CNN the claims are “ridiculous.”  2. G7 Summit  The G7 summit convenes this weekend in France, and all eyes, as usual, will be on President Trump. Let’s start with the good: Though the US economy is not as strong as it has been, it’s still better off than most of the declining economies in Europe, so Trump is expected to do a little boasting about that. But recent divisive comments could cause some discomfort among the world leaders. The whole buying Greenland discussion and Denmark trip cancellation could sow some discord, as could Trump’s outspoken support of Brexit. In fact, French President Emmanuel Macron has elected to forego the customary signing of an agreement by all the leaders at the end of the summit. Trump refused to sign the deal at the end of last year’s summit in Canada and left the gathering early.   3. Japan and South Korea  The feud between Japan and South Korea is getting worse, and it looks like China and North Korea could come out as winners. Japan and South Korea are engaged in a bitter trade dispute, and South Korea took the tension up a notch yesterday by scrapping its military intelligence-sharing agreement with Japan. The conflict has threatened global tech manufacturers and important alliances, but China and North Korea have seen incidental benefits. The breakdown of communication between Japan and South Korea means security cooperation and monitoring of North Korea has diminished. It also alienates the US, which holds a strong military alliance with South Korea and Japan. With those links weakened, China may move to increase its influence in the region.   4. Nigerian scams  Federal prosecutors have charged 80 people, most of them Nigerian, in a web of scams that the US claims has robbed millions of dollars from businesses and elderly people. Seventeen so far have been arrested. Two of the men indicted allegedly ran a romance scam out of California. In this kind of scheme, scammers reach out to women online and start relationships via emails and messages. Those usually escalate to outrageous claims of hardship and requests for money. In one scam said to have been perpetrated by the men, a Japanese woman sent her online love interest – really a scammer – several payments to help him smuggle a bag of diamonds out of Syria. US prosecutors estimate the suspects together have bilked $6 million. All will face charges of conspiracy to commit fraud and to launder money, and aggravated identity theft. Some also will face fraud and money laundering charges.  5. Rohingya  This week marks the two-year anniversary of the campaign of violence started by Myanmar’s military against the Rohingya people, an ethnic Muslim minority. In that time, hundreds of thousands of Rohingya people have been left effectively stateless and many have had to seek refuge in camps along the border with Bangladesh. The two countries yesterday were supposed to start repatriating about 3,450 of the Rohingya refugees, but there’s a problem: Some of the refugees don’t want to be repatriated for fear of further violence and oppression. International human rights organizations have expressed concern about the planned repatriation, saying the Rohingya people would be walking right back into the persecution that drove them out in the first place.   BREAKFAST BROWSE The first Titanic dive in 14 years shows how the ocean floor is swallowing up the wreck So … no movie sequel, then?   US travel to Canada is at its highest since 2007  We just love our northern neighbors (and readers!) so much!

Tracey Milanovich, 37, is charged with six counts of obtaining property over $250 by trick, attempt to commit a crime, criminal harassment, larceny over $1,200 and intimidating a witness, a spokesman for the Fall River District Court in Somerset, Massachusetts, told CNN. She pleaded not guilty at her arraignment on Monday and was released on personal recognizance. Her next court appearance is scheduled for February 21, the court said. CNN called Milanovich’s attorney for comment but has not yet received a response. Through a business called Tracy’s Psychic Palm Reader, police said Milanovich convinced a client that she needed to provide cash and purchase household items, including towels and bedding, to banish a spirit from her daughter. Milanovich was found to have stolen approximately $71,000 from the woman, the department said. Milanovich was arrested on December 27.

    "content": "Hillary Clinton’s campaign said Saturday it will take part in efforts to push for recounts in several key states, joining with Green Party candidate Jill Stein, who has raised millions of dollars to have votes counted again in Wisconsin.  But, in a post on Medium, Marc Elias, the campaign’s counsel, said the campaign’s own investigation has not uncovered any evidence of hacking of voting systems. In the campaign’s most detailed comments to date on the recount, Elias wrote that while the campaign was not going to contest the results itself, it has decided now to take part in the effort to “ensure that it is fair to all sides.” On Monday, Michigan’s secretary of state office announced that President-elect Donald Trump won Michigan’s 16 electoral votes. That brought the final electoral tally for Trump 306, while former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has 232 electoral votes.  Clinton continues to lead Trump for the country’s popular vote by about 2 million votes, and the lead is likely to grow as votes continue to be counted.  But Trump on Saturday dismissed the recount and said that “the election is over.” “The people have spoken and the election is over, and as Hillary Clinton herself said on election night, in addition to her conceding by congratulating me, ‘We must accept this result and then look to the future,’” Trump said in a statement, which called the recount “ridiculous” in a headline. A ‘scam’ The President-elect blasted the Green Party’s effort as a “scam” and accused the party’s nominee, Jill Stein, of trying to reel in donations that she won’t actually spend on a recount. “This recount is just a way for Jill Stein, who received less than one percent of the vote overall and wasn’t even on the ballot in many states, to fill her coffers with money, most of which she will never even spend on this ridiculous recount,” Trump said. “This is a scam by the Green Party for an election that has already been conceded, and the results of this election should be respected instead of being challenged and abused, which is exactly what Jill Stein is doing.” Stein dismissed Trump’s suggestion that the funds wouldn’t be spent on the recount. “For his information, this is all going into a dedicated and segregated account so that it can only be spent on the recount,” she told CNN’s Pamela Brown on “Newsroom.” “He may be creating his own facts here as he’s been known to do some times in the past,” Stein added. “He himself said it was rigged election unless he won it.” On Saturday night, Trump tweeted, “The Green Party scam to fill up their coffers by asking for impossible recounts is now being joined by the badly defeated & demoralized Dems.”  Discrepancies  Green Party officials filed Friday for a recount in Wisconsin after reports of voting discrepancies. Wisconsin Green Party co-chairman George Martin said that the party was seeking a “reconciliation of paper records” – a request that would go one step further than a simple recount, which is expected to begin next week, and that he hopes will spur an investigation into the integrity of the state’s voting system. “This is a process, a first step to examine whether our electoral democracy is working,” Martin said.  Stein tweeted Saturday that she’s willing to expand the recount to other states. “I will do a recount in any state where the deadline has not passed. Help my staff find state deadlines … #Recount2016,” she said. Elias said the campaign had been quietly investigating accusations for a while and had received hundreds of requests that it do so.     “Because we had not uncovered any actionable evidence of hacking or outside attempts to alter the voting technology, we had not planned to exercise this option ourselves, but now that a recount has been initiated in Wisconsin, we intend to participate in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides,” Elias wrote on Medium.  “If Jill Stein follows through as she has promised and pursues recounts in Pennsylvania and Michigan, we will take the same approach in those states as well,” he added.  Brian Fallon, spokesman for the Clinton campaign, said the team would not have sought the recount on its own and that they see no evidence of tampering so far.  “We note we are guarding our prerogatives now that someone else has launched a recount. Not sure what you could point to to suggest there is anything here that calls the results into question,” he told CNN.  Interference? In addition to Trump’s total combined margin of victory in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania being about 107,000 votes – by contrast, the Florida margin in Bush-Gore was 537 ballots – Elias said concerns about Russia’s interference in the election continue to raise concerns. “This election cycle was unique in the degree of foreign interference witnessed throughout the campaign: the U.S. government concluded that Russian state actors were behind the hacks of the Democratic National Committee and the personal email accounts of Hillary for America campaign officials, and just yesterday, the Washington Post reported that the Russian government was behind much of the “fake news” propaganda that circulated online in the closing weeks of the election,” he wrote. A senior administration official said in a statement that there is no evidence of any hacking. “The federal government did not observe any increased level of malicious cyber activity aimed at disrupting our electoral process on Election Day,” the official said. “As we have noted before, we remained confident in the overall integrity of electoral infrastructure, a confidence that was borne out on Election Day. As a result, we believe our elections were free and fair from a cybersecurity perspective.” Two million The Clinton campaign has met with lawyers, data scientists and analysts to assess anomalies in the results that would suggest a hacked result. Private meetings with outside experts involved sharing both groups concerns about the data and findings.  Clinton’s team said they investigated every theory presented and examined laws and practices pertaining to recounts, contests and audits. “And most importantly, we have monitored and staffed the post-election canvasses – where voting machine tapes are compared to poll-books, provisional ballots are resolved, and all of the math is double checked from election night,” Elias said. “During that process, we have seen Secretary Clinton’s vote total grow, so that, today, her national popular vote lead now exceeds more than 2 million votes.” The campaign plans to move forward in monitoring activities to better understand the results. “In the coming days, we will continue to perform our due diligence and actively follow all further activities that are to occur prior to the certification of any election results,” he said. It is “unfortunate” that all states don’t conduct “post-election” audits. “Wisconsin and Pennsylvania conduct post-election audits using a sampling of precincts. Michigan and many other states still do not,” Elias wrote. “This is unfortunate; it is our strong belief that, in addition to an election canvass, every state should do this basic audit to ensure accuracy and public confidence in the election.”",

    "content": "Three top Pakistani cricketers were jailed Thursday after being convicted of plotting to cheat and to take bribes in a match against England last summer, in a scandal that rocked the international sport. Former national team captain Salman Butt was sentenced to 30 months and bowler Mohammad Asif to a year in prison after they were found guilty by a London court Tuesday. Fellow bowler Mohammad Amir, a rising star in the sport at the age of 19, was given a six-month jail term, having pleaded guilty. A fourth man, London-based businessman Mazhar Majeed, was jailed for two years and eight months for his role as an agent who arranged the betting scam. He had also pleaded guilty. All will serve half of their sentences before being eligible for parole. The Pakistanis were accused of spot fixing, or rigging parts of a test match. The trial and sentencing have been closely watched in Pakistan, where cricket is a hugely popular sport. The Pakistan Cricket Board, the sport’s national governing body, said the trio’s conviction and sentencing was “a sad day for Pakistan cricket.” Spokesman Nadeem Sarwar said in a statement: “Instead of having pride in playing for their country, these players chose to disappoint their supporters, damage the image of their country and bring the noble game of cricket into disrepute. There is little sympathy in Pakistan for the sorry pass they have come to.” He said the board was determined to stamp out corrupt behavior within cricket and will introduce measures to do that. These include better training in the game’s rules and ethics for players, alongside stricter monitoring, a strengthened code of conduct for agents and others involved in the game and a recommendation to the government to pass a law making corruption in sport a criminal offense. Imran Khan, former cricketer turned politician, told domestic channel Geo TV after the sentencing: “For Pakistan and for Pakistani cricket this is extremely detrimental.  “This will bring shame to our country and the families of the cricketers. I can’t imagine what the family is going through. Right now this is bad for all of us.” He said he felt special sympathy for Amir, the youngest, who had probably gotten involved after seeing the others getting away with match fixing. Asif’s father also appeared on Geo TV, saying: “Jails are made for men, so what if my son is sent there.”  He accused unspecified foreign governments of being behind his son’s conviction, but he said the family would not starve as a result. Butt’s sister, Rubab Butt, also told reporters her brother was innocent. “My brother didn’t do anything wrong,” she said. “There has been no evidence presented to us about his guilt and the decision was wrong, we disagree with it. My brother is innocent.”  Butt and Asif had denied the charges. Before the sentencing, Amir expressed remorse in a statement read by his lawyer. “First I want to apologize to Pakistan and to everyone that cricket is important to,” he said. “I do know how much damage this has done to the game, a game which I love more than anything else in the world.  “I did decide many months ago that I wanted to admit that I deliberately threw two no-balls (fouls) at the Lord’s Test last summer. But I know this was very late, and I want to apologize for not saying it before. I didn’t find the courage to do it at the beginning, and I know very well that made everything much more difficult.” The Pakistanis are among the lowest-paid of the main cricket nations, partly due to the loss of much-needed revenue from hosting tours. International teams have turned down offers to play in Pakistan after a 2009 terrorist attack on the touring Sri Lankan team in Lahore.    ",

    "content": "Hundreds of Oasis fans are looking back in anger after falling victim to a “landslide” of ticket selling scams. The fans have lost £346 ($449) on average to fraudsters ahead of the British band’s reunion tour next year, with some losing as much as £1,000 ($1,298), UK lender Lloyds Banking Group said Tuesday. Lloyds said in a press release that an analysis of fraud reports lodged by its customers in the month following Oasis’ August announcement of its comeback tour also showed that more than 90% of the scams began with adverts on social media and that the “vast majority” started on Facebook. A spokesperson for Meta (META) told CNN that Facebook’s parent company is “continually investing in protections against fraud on (its) platforms.” “We advise our community to report any scams immediately so we can take action,” the spokesperson said, noting that Meta recently launched a pilot program allowing UK banks to share information with the company, including about ticket scams. Lloyds said Oasis fans made up around 70% of all reported ticket fraud between August 27 and September 25. The bank noted that scammers usually post fake adverts on social media for either discounted prices or tickets at inflated prices for events that have already sold out, collecting fans’ money via a bank transfer for tickets that don’t exist. “The fact that so many cases start with fake listings on social media, often in violation of the platforms’ own rules, underscores the importance of these companies taking stronger action to tackle scams,” said Liz Ziegler, fraud prevention director at Lloyds. “Buying directly from reputable, authorized platforms is the only way to guarantee you’re paying for a genuine ticket. If you’re asked to pay via bank transfer, particularly by a seller you’ve found on social media, that should immediately set alarm bells ringing.” Fraudsters have pounced on Oasis fans since the band — a staple of 1990s Britpop, led by quarreling brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher — announced that it would reunite for the first time since 2009, playing multiple shows across the United Kingdom and Ireland next summer. It later also announced tour dates in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Australia. Fans scrambling for tickets have fumed about eye-watering prices and long waits online. Last month, Oasis’ tour promoters Live Nation and SJM told CNN that they were canceling around 50,000 tickets for the band’s UK concerts that were being resold on unofficial secondary sites, in an effort to prevent price gouging. Lloyds said its customers buying Oasis tickets on a major UK ticket selling site splashed out more compared with any other music concert over the past three years, parting with an average of £563 ($731) per debit card transaction during the first day of ticket sales in August. That’s higher than the average £342 ($444) spent on tickets for Taylor Swift’s UK tour last year, it noted.",

    "content": "A New Jersey woman faces four years in state prison for her role in scamming more than $400,000 from GoFundMe donors, claiming to be collecting money for a homeless man in Philadelphia.   Katelyn McClure, 29, pleaded guilty to one count of theft by deception in the second degree Monday in Burlington County, New Jersey.   In the viral story from 2017 that made national headlines, New Jersey resident McClure ran out of gas and was stranded on Interstate 95 in Philadelphia. The homeless man, Johnny Bobbitt Jr., supposedly saw her and gave her his last $20 for gas.  McClure and her then-boyfriend, Mark D’Amico, posted about the “good deed” on social media, including a picture of her with Bobbitt on a highway ramp. They also started a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for the homeless man, saying they wanted to pay it forward to the good Samaritan and get him off the streets.   Bobbitt pleaded guilty at the local level to one count of conspiracy to commit theft by deception last Friday. He faces a five-year special probation period that requires him to enter the state Superior Court drug court program, in which he’ll be expected to get a job and adhere to a structured regimen of treatment and recovery services. Any infractions could bring him a five-year prison sentence, according to Joel Bewley, a spokesman for the Burlington County Prosecutor’s Office.  CNN reached out to Bobbitt’s attorney for comment, but has not heard back.   Both Bobbitt and McClure agreed to testify against D’Amico, who has yet to enter a plea in Burlington County court on charges of theft by deception and conspiracy to commit theft by deception in the second degree. His case is scheduled to be presented next month to a Burlington County grand jury for a possible indictment.   Both McClure and Bobbitt also pleaded guilty to federal charges in early March.  D’Amico is not currently facing federal charges.    McClure’s lawyer said she had tried to stop the GoFundMe page and D’Amico wouldn’t let her.  “We’ve indicated throughout it’s my view that Mr. D’Amico is the real agent provocateur in this matter.  Kate’s role from the beginning was to help Mr. Bobbitt,” said McClure’s attorney, Jim Gerrow.    “Kate has been strong. She’s devastated by this and has been, but we look to the sentencings in federal and state courts and hopefully we can find sufficient evidence to convince both judges of her role and the fact that throughout this she started out with benign motive, her hope to help Johnny Bobbitt and not to enrich herself or anyone else,” Gerrow said.  The couple transferred the funds to their bank account and bought a BMW, expensive handbags and went on trips, including to casinos in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Nevada, according to court documents.  McClure transferred $25,000 from her bank account to Bobbitt’s in December 2017, federal prosecutors said. He received a total of $75,000 in the campaign, according to Burlington County Prosecutor Scott Coffina.  GoFundMe has since made refunds to thousands of people who donated thinking they were giving to Bobbitt. Both Bobbitt and McClure must pay back the money in restitution, per their state court plea deals.   The story began to fall apart after Bobbitt sued McClure and D’Amico, accusing them of withholding the money raised on his behalf.   “In reality, McClure never ran out of gas and Bobbitt never spent his last $20 for her,” according to a US Attorney’s Office press release. “D’Amico and McClure allegedly conspired to create the false story to obtain money from donors.”  The federal cases have not been settled. McClure could face up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine after pleading guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. She will be sentenced on June 19.  Bobbitt could face up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine on the federal charge after pleading guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. He will be sentenced at a later date. ",

    "content": "The former president of a California real estate firm and his wife pleaded guilty in federal court on Wednesday for using their wealth to improperly get their children into prominent universities as part of the college admissions scandal. Bruce Isackson, 62, and Davina Isackson, 55, are cooperating with the government in the case. They pleaded guilty in Boston to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud. Bruce Isackson also pleaded guilty to money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to defraud the IRS for taking a tax deduction for the bribe. Authorities say the Isacksons agreed to pay William “Rick” Singer, the man central to the alleged scam, a total of $600,000 in stock value. In exchange for the payment, Singer helped get a fraudulent ACT exam score for one daughter and facilitated two daughters’ acceptance to UCLA and USC by falsely labeling them as recruited athletes. The US Attorney’s Office will not be seeking any additional charges against the couple and recommended sentences at the low end of the guidelines. Prosecutors will suggest a sentence of 37-46 months in prison for Bruce Isackson and 27-33 months for Davina Isackson at their sentencing hearing July 31. Isackson had been the president of WP Investments, a real estate firm in Woodside, California, according to a since-deleted version of the company’s website.  The Isacksons are among the 14 wealthy parents who have pleaded guilty in the sprawling admissions scam. Another 19 parents, including actress Lori Loughlin and her husband, designer Mossimo Giannulli, have pleaded not guilty to charges of fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy. Federal prosecutors have also issued subpoenas to other parents who were not charged in the original complaint or indictment, according to a law enforcement official. Prosecutors are looking for financial records and call logs for those parents, the official said.  Additionally, three students who have not been charged have received target letters from prosecutors, according to the US Attorney’s Office in Boston.   Lori Loughlin’s daughters have not been sent target letters related to the college admissions scandal, a source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN. In court Wednesday, prosecutors said Elizabeth Henriquez – a parent who has pleaded not guilty in connection with the scheme – told the Isacksons about Singer and made the introduction.  Both Isacksons waived their right to a grand jury indictment in court. They each spoke to answer procedural questions from the judge. Bruce Isackson wore a dark blue suit with his hands folded.  As the judge read the charges against Davina Isackson, her attorney patted her on the back. A dozen other parents, including actress Felicity Huffman, will also formally enter guilty pleas later this month. What they did  In addition to using the college exam cheating scheme for one daughter, the Isacksons also considered doing so for another child before they were arrested, authorities said. “I think we’ll definitely pay cash this time, and not, not – not run it through the other way,” Bruce Isackson told Singer in a recorded conversation, the complaint says. Singer has pleaded guilty to leading the scheme and is cooperating with the government. The criminal complaint states the Isacksons used Singer’s services to try to get their eldest daughter into USC as a women’s soccer player. Due to a “clerical error,” her application was sent into the regular admissions pool.  Months later, then-USC soccer coach Ali Khosroshahin, who is also charged in the scandal, forwarded their daughter’s soccer profile to the head coach of UCLA men’s soccer as a “soccer player/student manager.” She was then admitted to UCLA. Afterward, Davina Isackson thanked Singer in an email and copied Bruce Isackson and the daughter on the email, the complaint states. “I know it has been a rough ride but I thank you from the bottom of my heart and soul for your persistence, creativity and commitment towards helping [our daughter],” she wrote.  The Isacksons also participated in the scam to boost their second daughter’s test scores and secure admittance into USC as a crew recruit, even though she did not row competitively, according to the complaint. Authorities also say the Isacksons underpaid their federal income taxes by deducting the bribe payments as purported charitable contributions.",

    "content": "Who would have thought that getting naked and naughty with a stranger online could have negative consequences? It turns out that in addition to the potential for walk-ins by significant others and soul-crushing lack of self-respect in the morning, would-be Internet Lotharios now have to worry about being blackmailed. Police in Singapore are reporting what appears to be a ring (or rings) of online scam artists who use attractive women to “friend” victims on social sites, seduce them into cybersex on webcams and then threaten to post images or videos of them online if they don’t pay up. “They would commence a webcam conversation with the victims and initiate cybersex by undressing themselves first before persuading the male victims to appear nude or perform sexual acts in front of the webcams,” the Singapore Police Force wrote in a post on its website. “Unknown to the victims, the suspects had recorded the acts.” According to the police, more than 50 such cases were reported in 2012, up from 11 the previous year. In the wonderfully sensational style of journalism reminiscent of Next Media Animation’s “animated news” (the Taiwanese folks who showed us Tiger Woods’ 2009 traffic mishap and Steve Jobs turning into a ninja) Singapore TV station HD 5 created a 10-minute “reconstruction” of the scam. It shows our hero Danny, a dorky student, being “friended” on Facebook by the lovely Lilly, who proceeds to talk him out of his pants on camera before abruptly disappearing. The tryst-gone-wrong is then followed by an e-mail and phone call from a shadowy dude demanding $50,000. Poor Danny. Graham Cluley, of Web security firm Sophos, warns that if such a scam spreads, it could encompass more than just blackmail. “You can imagine how a man, believing he is being seduced online by a sexy woman, might be all too eager to click on a link she suggests or run a malicious program on his computer,” Cluley wrote on his blog. “Before he knows it, his computer could be under the control of a hacker.” It was unclear Monday whether Singapore Police have made any arrests related to the scams. A message to the police force was not immediately returned. Singapore Police warn potential targets to be wary of strangers befriending them on social networks and to avoid giving away personal details or “performing compromising acts” with people you barely know. The police also urge users to call authorities immediately if someone tries to extort money from you. Cluley adds a simpler word of advice: “Be careful out there, and keep your trousers on, chaps.”",

    "content": "Meet Billie Eilish. She’s the first artist born in the 2000s to have a No. 1 album. (Yes, that makes us feel really old.) Here’s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. (You can also get “5 Things You Need to Know Today” delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Politics Top Trump administration officials faced off against agitated House Democrats on Capitol Hill. It didn’t go well at all: • Democrats on the House Judiciary committee were livid at Attorney General William Barr after he said he’d release a redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report within a week. Chairman Jerry Nadler promised a subpoena demanding more. The Dems also didn’t like that Barr wouldn’t say whether the White House had been briefed on the Mueller report. • Over at the House Financial Services Committee hearing, Democrats blasted Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin after he said his agency’s lawyers talked to the White House about releasing President Trump’s tax returns. Mnuchin said that’s not interference because the lawyers weren’t being directed by Team Trump. US Rep. Maxine Waters and others were very skeptical of that claim. Meanwhile, at a House Judiciary hearing on hate crimes and white nationalism on social media, all hell broke loose. YouTube had to disable the comments on the livestream of the hearing because they were filled with anti-Semitic and racist remarks. And Democratic US Rep. Ted Lieu ticked off conservatives by playing a clip of conservative activist Candace Owens saying Adolf Hitler’s motive “to make Germany great” was “fine.” Owens said Lieu took her remarks out of context.  2. Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his opponent, Benny Gantz, are both claiming victory in Israel’s election. Right now, the contest is too close to call, with Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud party neck and neck with Gantz’s centrist Blue and White party, with 90% of the vote in. But Netanyahu, seeking a record fifth term, has an advantage. To form a governing coalition in the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, a candidate needs at least 61 seats. It looks like Netanyahu’s political bloc, made up of right-wing and ultra-Orthodox parties, will have 65 seats. Gantz’s bloc of center-left parties will only have 55 seats. Israel’s President will decide who gets to form the next government, and that decision will probably come next week.  3. College admissions scandal Sixteen wealthy parents are facing new charges in the college admissions scam scandal. The parents, including actress Lori Loughlin of “Full House” fame, were indicted on money laundering charges. These add to the conspiracy to commit fraud charges they were hit with last month. These new charges were announced just a day after 13 other parents, including actress Felicity Huffman, and a coach agreed to plead guilty in the case, dubbed Operation Varsity Blues. Prosecutors allege parents in the case used their wealth to cheat on standardized tests for their children and bribe college administrators and coaches who held sway over admissions.  4. Missing US couple The mystery of what happened to a New York couple that disappeared in the Dominican Republic may be solved. But the news isn’t good. Authorities think the couple’s rental car plunged into the ocean as they made their way to the airport on March 27 to catch a flight home. They say a woman, who didn’t have ID, was found on the airport road that day and taken to a hospital, where she died eight days later. Meantime, the body of a man matching the description of Orlando Moore was found at sea. He and Portia Ravenelle were supposed to return to New York after vacationing on the Caribbean island.  5. Weather Flooding. Hurricane-force winds. Record snowfall. Welcome to spring in the West and Midwest. More than 40 million people are under wind-related advisories, and about 4 million are under blizzard warnings. Parts of Utah, Nevada, western Wyoming, Idaho and California are bracing for wind gusts of 74 mph, while people in Colorado, Nebraska, the Dakotas, Iowa, Wyoming and Kansas will hunker down for a blizzard. In the Plains, more than 2 feet of snow could fall by Friday. The threat of more flooding is high in the Missouri Valley, where many towns remain drenched after last month’s record-breaking floods.

    "content": "Police in Spain have arrested five people accused of scamming two women out of 325,000 euros ($362,000) by pretending to be Hollywood star Brad Pitt online. Ten other people were also investigated as part of Operation Bralina, which spanned eight provinces, according to a statement from the Guardia Civil published Monday. One woman lost 175,000 euros ($195,000) to the fraudsters, while another lost 150,000 euros ($167,000). Of that total, police managed to recover 85,000 euros ($95,000). Both victims were contacted via a Brad Pitt fan site by fraudsters who managed to convince them that the actor wanted to invest in various projects with them, police said. “In order to find their victims, the cyber criminals studied their social networks and put together a psychological profile of them, discovering as a result that both women were vulnerable people suffering from depression and a lack of affection,” reads the statement. “They also used instant messaging platforms to exchange messages and emails with the two women until they thought they were chatting via WhatsApp with Brad Pitt himself, who promised them a romantic relationship and a future together.” Both women ended up making numerous bank transfers to the person they thought was Pitt, until they realized they had been scammed and went to the police. Investigators found that, as part of the scam, a network of bank accounts were created using fake identity documents. “Mules” were also used to help to launder money through their own bank accounts in exchange for a small payment.",

    "content": "The sentencing of a woman who made up a feel-good story and raised more than $400,000 as part of a GoFundMe scam has been delayed until September. Katelyn McClure, 29, has pleaded guilty to one count of theft by deception in the second degree in Burlington County, New Jersey, and she is now expected to be sentenced on September 16, said Joel Bewley, Burlington County Prosecutor’s Office spokesman. The charge, as well as a federal charge of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, stemmed from a viral 2017 story in which she supposedly ran out of gas and was stranded on I-95 in Philadelphia.  A homeless man, Johnny Bobbitt Jr., supposedly saw her and gave her his last $20 for gas, and McClure and her then-boyfriend, Mark D’Amico, posted about the “good deed” on social media and started a GoFundMe to raise money for him. But the feel-good story was not true. Bobbitt pleaded guilty at the local level to one count of conspiracy to commit theft by deception, and both Bobbitt and McClure pleaded guilty to a federal charge as well. Both Bobbitt and McClure have agreed to testify against D’Amico as part of their plea deal. D’Amico was indicted in May in Burlington County court on six charges, including conspiracy, financial facilitation of criminal activity and theft by deception, the prosecutor’s office said.  D’Amico’s attorney, Mark Davis, said his client was arraigned and pleaded not guilty to the charges. His next hearing in the case is set for August 26.",

    "content": "Cybercriminals have in recent months stolen hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of shipments from US food suppliers by placing fraudulent orders for milk products, the FBI and other federal agencies warned on Friday.  The unnamed criminal groups set up email accounts impersonating top executives of food companies and convinced their suppliers to ship them truckloads of powdered milk, according to the advisory from the FBI, Food and Drug Administration, and Department of Agriculture. In some cases, the suppliers had already shipped well over $100,000 of milk products before realizing they had been conned, prompting the federal agencies to urge companies to “consider taking steps to protect their brand and reputation.” It’s the latest example of a type of fraud known as business email compromise (BEC) that has cost Americans far more than any other type of online crime. The FBI received nearly 20,000 BEC complaints last year with estimated losses of $2.4 billion.  In some cases, big pots of federal money have been stolen. In August, someone tricked officials in Lexington, Kentucky, into wiring them $4 million in federal funding that was meant for housing assistance  BEC attacks, however, don’t command the same national attention as ransomware attacks – which lock victims’ computers until a ransom is paid – because they are less noticeable and don’t create disruptions like computer outages. And while multimillion-dollar ransom payments grab headlines, BEC thefts can be smaller sums for individual victims.  But the rampant nature of BEC theft is a top concern for FBI and Secret Service agents.  “We’re talking billions of dollars in loss, and it’s life-impacting loss that a lot of these are having,” Stephen Dougherty, a Secret Service official who investigates BEC fraud, previously told CNN. He oversees a team of agents that investigates BEC fraud around the world and tries to intercept fraudulent money transfers before it’s too late.   As of August, the Secret Service said it had prevented it about $30 million in losses from BEC scams this year. But timing is critical for thwarting fraudulent wire transfers.  “If these aren’t reported to us quickly, chances are slim we can get a recovery,” Dougherty said. And BEC fraudsters are increasingly targeting the shipment of goods, and not just wire transfers, as the FBI advisory makes clear.  “We’ve been seeing a rapidly growing number of BEC attacks impersonating external third parties, primarily supposed vendors or suppliers,” Crane Hassold, a former behavioral analyst at the FBI, told CNN. “If a company produces or sells a tangible [business-to-business] product, they’re a potential target of an attack like this,” said Hassold, who is now director of threat intelligence at cybersecurity firm Abnormal Security.",

    "content": "It’s one of the world’s longest-running cons. Hundreds of millions of dollars stolen from some of the world’s most vulnerable people – the sick, the elderly and the poor – who all thought they had found a savior in a mysterious woman named Maria Duval.   It has claimed more than 60 times the number of victims of Madoff’s Ponzi scheme. With millions of people affected from the United States to Japan, federal investigators say it would be hard to find another case of consumer fraud that has hurt more people. Since the alleged mail fraud started around 20 years ago, a laundry list of government agencies across the globe – including the U.S. Department of Justice, British authorities, Canadian fraud investigators and Australian consumer protection officials – have attempted to put an end to the scheme.  But somehow, it has raged on for decades. It all centers around a mysterious French psychic named Maria Duval. In letters, interviews and Internet videos seen around the globe, Duval says she has had visions of the world exploding and humans living in space. She claims to have successfully predicted election results, forecast winning lottery numbers and helped police investigate crimes. She says she even found the missing dog of movie star Brigitte Bardot. And millions of people have been convinced by her “personalized” letters that she can help them, too. In what appear to be handwritten notes signed by Duval, she tells them they could win the lottery, recover from ailments or avoid terrible misfortune. All they need to do is pay a small sum – often around $40 – to receive her guidance, lucky numbers and special talismans like a Five Forces Stone or a Vibratory Crystal.  While many recipients would simply dismiss these letters, the scheme’s massive success stems from its ability to take advantage of emotionally and financially vulnerable people. Many of its victims are elderly, often suffering from dementia or Alzheimer’s. Others are lonely or depressed and are touched that someone is thinking of them. “Not only was my poor mother quickly losing her mind due to Alzheimer’s disease, she was lonely, bored, wanting to be wealthy and well,” said Chrissie Stevens of her late mother Doreen Robinson, who fell prey to this scheme. Already hooked? Follow our hunt by signing up for updates here  As her health and mental capacities diminished, Robinson sent more and more money to Duval – sometimes as often as twice a day – eventually adding up to more than $2,400 in a single year. (Other victims have lost even more. Click here to read their stories.)  And Duval was just one of the schemes Stevens discovered her mother, 80 years old at the time, had fallen victim to. She ultimately realized her mother was tens of thousands of dollars in debt and had been sending much of her monthly fixed-income payments straight to Duval and other scammers. Robinson passed away in September of 2014, and Stevens is still brought to tears remembering her months-long battle to try to rip her mother free of Duval’s grasp. Even after her mother promised to stop sending in more payments, Stevens found an envelope stuffed with cash and change that she had been hiding, hoping to send to her “friend” Maria. Elderly, broke and homeless: The victims of a $200 million psychic scam “She didn’t have the quality of mind anymore to realize how much money she was losing or how often she was sending money,” said Stevens. “She put value on silly, worthless, two-cent amulets she’d paid a fortune for and received nothing of value in return.” Duval has been the subject of horror stories like this for years. But we didn’t learn about her until late September, when we were combing through piles of solicitations sent to seniors. Several readers had sent us this junk mail urging us to look into the many unscrupulous nonprofits, political groups and flat-out scammers that prey on the elderly by mail. Among the mailings, we found a letter from a psychic named Patrick Guerin and were intrigued by its many details and promises – of lottery winnings, luck and happiness. In a quick Google search, it became clear that all sorts of psychics are targeting seniors. But one name kept coming up: Maria Duval. Duval’s own website showcased glowing testimonials from happy customers, international press clippings and links to media appearances and video clips where a French-speaking woman claiming to be Duval speaks about her psychic “gift.” But the search also revealed website upon website filled with emotional complaints from people who had been scammed out of their savings. Through our research, we learned of an 88-year-old U.S. military veteran who sent Duval $4,000 hoping to win the lottery so he could afford assisted living. And a young British girl who reportedly drowned with one of Duval’s letters in her pocket after becoming obsessed with the psychic.  Who is Maria Duval? Email us with your stories, theories and feedback While there is no way to know just how many people have been duped by the scheme, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service alleges that the operation (which has included additional letters sent out by Guerin, her psychic sidekick) has claimed more than 1.4 million victims in the United States alone. “It’s remarkable,” said Postal Inspector Clayton Gerber. “Maria Duval’s name comes up in almost every major country.” How have Duval’s letters been able to reel in so many victims? It starts with so-called sucker lists. Federal court documents claim Duval’s network zeroed in on potential victims by purchasing personal details, like names and addresses from data brokers that typically sell this information to marketers or retailers. Advertisements placed in newspapers around the world have solicited this data too. These ads sometimes don’t mention Duval’s name at all. Instead they ask readers to send in everything from their zodiac sign and time of birth to their marital status – all under the guise of a research study where they could end up winning large amounts of money. By using this valuable information, Duval’s letters can seem shockingly prescient. “You are mainly under the influence of Venus. In addition to being born on May 22, 1927 in Kansas City at 12:00, I can already see some aspects of your personality,” Duval wrote to one of her victims. Tens of thousands of these letters have been sent out per month, allegedly adding up to millions of mailings in a single year in the U.S. alone. We’ve seen some as long as sixteen pages, and others that include coffee cup stains and little notes scrawled in the margins to make them look more realistic. Many letters then ask victims for more personal information along with their payments – sometimes even requesting mementos like photos or locks of hair.  “As soon as I have your photo (or the strands of hair from your head) in my possession, I am going to be able to concentrate all my psychic strengths further,” Duval wrote in one of her letters. “I will keep the photo with me for the months and years to come so my contact as a medium can be with you permanently.” Once victims responded, Duval would reply offering additional help – again for a price. In some replies, she would introduce victims to her psychic friend Guerin, who would then send his own letters offering even more good fortune and seeking even more money. We reviewed a handful of the 1,500 letters written by victims in response to Duval that were recovered by U.S. officials in a matter of weeks. These letters  tell a story of desperation – detailing large debts, illnesses and worries about Social Security and Medicare benefits. For some victims, their correspondence with Duval turns into their most cherished relationship – one that can distance them from their family and friends. Some even send Duval holiday cards. And many people have sent so many small payments to Duval that they have ended up giving thousands of dollars to her over the course of a few years. All of this money adds up to millions. In the U.S. and Canada alone, investigators estimate that the scheme has raked in more than $200 million since 1999.  Although there’s no estimate of how much money has been lost worldwide, we found traces of Duval’s letters in more than a dozen countries – most recently in Russia. But Duval herself remains a mystery. Even though her name is on all of the letters, international investigators can’t figure out who she really is – prompting people around the world to come up with their own theories. Some say she is actually the brainchild of an elderly Argentinean man, or cooked up by someone in Singapore. Many are adamant she’s a real person enjoying a luxurious retirement in the South of France, while others are convinced she is the creation of criminal cartels. “It is unclear whether Maria Duval is a real person or a fictitious character,” U.S. prosecutors said in court filings. But if Duval doesn’t exist, who is the blonde woman in the YouTube videos? And if she’s not in charge, who is really pulling the strings? And how have they evaded authorities for so long? Next Thursday, we begin our hunt for Maria Duval.",

The Diversity Visa program offers up to 55,000 visas worldwide each year to applicants “drawn from random selection among all entries to persons who meet strict eligibility requirements from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States,” according to the State Department website. The winners get green cards, meaning they are permanent residents of the U.S. It’s free to enter the random drawing through the State Department website dvlottery.state.gov. This year’s entry deadline was November 2. The embassy said any Iraqi who worked with a private entity to apply should be cautious, because  some people apparently have been sent letters instructing them to pay money up front.  ",

    "content": "At first glance, Daisy looks like your stereotypical grandmother: She loves knitting and talking about her family, has a cat named Fluffy, is technologically inept and has plenty of time to shoot the breeze. But dig a little deeper, and you’ll find her to be exceptionally tech-enabled, with a few cunning tricks up her sleeve. That’s because Daisy is a conversational artificial intelligence chatbot created by British mobile phone company O2 to help combat fraud by tricking phone scammers into thinking they are speaking to a real person. Her debut earlier this month highlights how AI is being used both positively and negatively when it comes to online scams. According to the Global Anti-Scam Alliance, a lobby group, consumers worldwide lost more than $1 trillion to online scams last year. A record $12.5 billion in losses from online scams was reported to the FBI in 2023, the bureau said in a report in March. But the US federal government has also praised the technology as “transformative” in helping the Treasury Department recover $1 billion worth of check fraud in the financial year that ended September 30. Daisy’s mission, according to O2, “is to talk with fraudsters and waste as much of their time as possible with human-like rambling chat to keep them away from real people.” Her tactics have kept “numerous fraudsters on calls for 40 minutes at a time,” the company said in a statement unveiling Daisy earlier this month. “With scammers operating fulltime call centres specifically to target Brits, we’re urging everyone to remain vigilant,” commented Murray Mackenzie, Virgin Media O2’s director of fraud. Last year, Virgin Media O2, the wider telecommunications group, blocked more than £250 million ($315 million) in suspected fraudulent transactions, which they say is equivalent to stopping one every two minutes. Using a custom large language model, Daisy can hold autonomous conversations with scam callers in real time. While she does not intercept any calls, she has multiple phone numbers of her own that O2 has worked to get into circulation online. Developed in partnership with London advertising agency VCCP, Daisy’s voice was modeled on a staff member’s grandmother. “Whilst anyone can be a victim of a scam, criminal fraud gangs often target the elderly so we leaned into scammers’ own biases to create an AI granny based on a real relative of a VCCP employee,” the agency said in a separate statement. “Over the course of many hours of scam calls she’s told meandering stories of her family, talked at length about her passion for knitting and provided false personal information including made-up bank details.” According to Virgin Media O2, Daisy was developed in response to research revealing that not wanting to waste their own time ranked as the top reason why the British public wouldn’t bait scammers themselves. Daisy, meanwhile, has “all the time in the world.” In fact, she has so much time on her hands that in the video unveiling her character one exasperated scammer can be heard yelling, “It’s nearly been an hour!” over the phone. Another fraudster tells her: “I think your profession is bothering people.” Her response? “I’m just trying to have a little chat.”",

    "content": "She appeared to be a beautiful woman and in the minds of men across Asia, the video calls they spoke on confirmed their newfound love was real. But Hong Kong police say the men had fallen prey to a romance scam that used deepfake artificial intelligence to lure its victims into parting with more than $46 million. In a news conference Monday, police in the Asian financial hub announced the arrests of more than two dozen members of the alleged scam ring, which they say targeted men from Taiwan to Singapore and as far away as India. Police said the 21 men and six women were held on charges including conspiracy to defraud following a raid on the gang’s alleged operating center at a 4,000-square-foot industrial unit in the city’s Hung Hom district. Aged 21 to 34, the suspects were mostly well-educated, with many of them digital media and technology graduates allegedly recruited by the gang after attending local universities, police said. The suspects allegedly worked with IT specialists overseas to build a fake cryptocurrency platform, where the victims were coerced to make investments, police added. Deepfakes are comprised of realistic fake video, audio and other content created with the help of AI. The technology is being increasingly adopted by a variety of bad actors, from people wishing to spread convincing disinformation to online scammers. “Pig-butchering” scams – named for the “fattening up” of victims before taking everything they have – are a multibillion-dollar illicit industry in which the con artists take on false online identities and spend months grooming their targets to get them to invest on bogus crypto sites. Deepfakes are  one more weapon in their arsenal to try and convince unsuspecting marks to part with money. Typically run by Chinese gangs out of Southeast Asia, it is unclear how widespread the crime is in Hong Kong, a wealthy city where police have long campaigned to raise awareness of telephone scams following several high-profile cases in which the victims –often elderly people – reported staggeringly high losses. But increasingly realistic deepfake technology has raised the stakes and put authorities on high alert. Earlier this year, a British multinational design and engineering company in Hong Kong lost $25 million to fraudsters after an employee was duped by scammers using deepfake tech to pose as its chief financial officer and other staff. According to Hong Kong police, the romance gang’s deepfake scam typically began with a text message, in which the sender – posing as an attractive woman – said they had mistakenly added the wrong number. The alleged scammers then struck up online romances with their victims, fostering a sense of intimacy until they began planning a future together. The group was highly organized, divided into departments responsible for different stages of the scam, police said. They even used a training manual to teach members how to carry out the con by taking advantage of “the victim’s sincerity and emotion,” said police, who posted parts of the manual on Facebook. Among the steps: learning about the victim’s worldview to create a “tailor-made” persona; inventing difficulties such as failed relationships or businesses to “deepen the other person’s trust”; and finally, painting a “beautiful vision” including travel plans together to push the victim into investing. The scam ran for about a year before police received intelligence about it around August, police said. More than 100 cell phones, the equivalent of nearly $26,000 in cash and a number of luxury watches were recovered in the raid, police said.",

    "content": "New York prosecutors Tuesday announced the indictments of an additional 32 people in a multimillion-dollar Social Security fraud scheme that involved retired cops and firefighters who falsely claimed to have suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. “Dozens of additional defendants have been charged with fabricating psychiatric conditions in order to fraudulently obtain Social Security disability insurance, a critically important social safety net reserved for those truly in need,” Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, Jr., said in a statement. “These defendants are accused of gaming the system by lying about their lifestyle, including their ability to work, drive, handle money, shop, and socialize, in order to obtain benefits to which they were not entitled.” The scandal first broke in January when the Manhattan prosecutors, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Investigations and New York police announced the indictments of 106 people, including many retired police and firefighters, for allegedly scamming the Social Security system by collecting insurance payments when they weren’t fully disabled. Of the 32 newly indicted defendants, at least six had pleaded not guilty Tuesday afternoon while others were expected to appear in court later. Sixteen of the new defendants were also collecting pension as retirees of the New York City Police Department, four from the New York City Fire Department, one from both the NYPD and FDNY, and one from the Department of Corrections, prosecutors said.   All the defendants previously arrested in the case have pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors have said in their cases that more than half the defendants received funds for fraudulent claims of post-traumatic stress disorder in the wake of the September terror attacks on the World Trade Center. The alleged scam spanned more than two decades, with law enforcement officers and firefighters coached on how to behave during doctor visits to qualify for full disability benefits, officials said. The defendants received up to $50,000 a year because, they claimed, they were no longer able to work, officials said. Many of the claims allegedly involved work-related trauma caused by the 9/11 terror attacks. The 9/11-related claims alone totaled hundreds of thousands of dollars. Prosecutors said four men at the center of the case directed and coached hundreds of Social Security Disability Insurance applicants, including many retirees of the New York police and fire departments, to lie about psychiatric conditions in order to obtain benefits.  Prosecutors said the defendants were meticulously instructed on how to fail memory tests with plausibility, how to dress and how to behave. Nearly every application included identical descriptions of daily living. The leaders of the scheme allegedly collected one-time cash payments based on the monthly disability awards,  ranging from approximately $20,000 to $50,000, prosecutors said. Some of those charged had gone on to hold other jobs, even though the full disability they received involved a diagnosis that they were so traumatized they were incapable of performing any kind of work, officials added.  In some instances, prosecutors said, the total amount fraudulently obtained was nearly $500,000 per applicant. The average Social Security disability Insurance payment to date for the defendants, which included retroactive lump sum payments, was about $210,000.",

Tre Brown, 19, was arrested January 14 after he allegedly created false returns at the Kroger store where he worked in Duluth, Georgia, according to a news release from Gwinnett County Police. He was charged with felony theft and released on bond the same day, according to online jail records.  Brown is accused of creating more than 40 returns ranging from $75 to over $87,000 for nonexistent items and putting refunds on several credit cards, according to the police. Detectives allege he stole more than $980,000 over two weeks before corporate employees from the grocery store chain noticed the fraudulent transactions and contacted the police, the news release said. Brown purchased two vehicles with the money, but totaled one of them before his arrest, the police statement said. It did not give details on the number or type of guns that police allege he purchased.  A substantial part of money was returned after his arrest, but Gwinnett Police Corporal Collin Flynn said they are still calculating the exact amount. CNN was not able to reach Brown for comment and it is unclear whether he has an attorney. In a statement to CNN, Kroger says it cannot comment on the ongoing investigation.",

    "content": "South Carolina Rep. Brandon Guffey was overwhelmed with rage when he first saw the man he believes caused his son’s suicide. The suspect was extradited from Nigeria to the US over the weekend on charges that he targeted 17-year-old Gavin Guffey in a sexual extortion, or “sextortion” scheme, that led to the teen’s death. The Nigerian appeared in court in Columbia, South Carolina, on Monday, where Brandon Guffey laid eyes on him after more than two years of fighting for justice for his son. “Rage is the best way to describe how I felt,” Guffey told CNN. “I think I cracked molars just gritting my teeth so hard.” The man, Hassanbunhussein Abolore Lawal, 24, did not make eye contact with him, Guffey said. Lawal kept his head bowed and appeared to avoid looking in his family’s direction, he said. As part of a sextortion scheme, Lawal allegedly masqueraded as a young woman on social media and sent Gavin nude photos. He asked for similar images of himself, and once Gavin shared the photos, the suspect threatened to publicize them if he didn’t pay, the Justice Department said. He’s pleaded not guilty to charges of child exploitation resulting in death, distribution of child sexual abuse material, coercion and enticement of a minor, cyberstalking, interstate threats with intent to extort and aiding/abetting, according to court records. At Monday’s hearing Guffey wore a black T-shirt with the love symbol &lt;3. It represents the last text message Gavin sent loved ones on July 27, 2022, minutes before he shot himself in a bathroom at the family home in Rock Hill, South Carolina. “I’m a roller coaster of emotions right now. I served in the house with a representative who lost his mother and sister in the Dylann Roof shootings down in Charleston. And those families were able to look at Dylann Roof and say, we forgive you,’” Guffey said. “I want to ask … ‘how do you have forgiveness in your heart?’ Because I just don’t have it. I have anger and vengeance. And every time I see my family’s pain over this, it just infuriates me more.” The scammer threatened other family members after Gavin Guffey’s death The FBI arrested Lawal in Lagos last week following an extradition hearing. CNN has reached out to his court-appointed attorney for comment. Guffey had to sign paperwork confirming he would not push for the death penalty to ensure that the Nigerian government approved the extradition, he said. Last week, he was shocked to get a call from federal investigators notifying him that the extradition had been approved and they were on their way to pick up Lawal. Investigators confirmed his arrival in Columbia on Saturday. “It was a surprise. I knew that they had been working on the process, but extradition was not something that commonly happens with Nigeria,” Guffey said. “There was still that anticipation and fear until his feet were actually on US soil.” At a press conference, investigators declined to provide details on how they tracked the suspect to Nigeria or whether there were other suspects involved. Some of the court documents in the case are sealed. “This investigation and extradition are the result of tremendous law enforcement coordination both in the United States and Nigeria,” said Adair Ford Boroughs, US Attorney for the District of South Carolina. “We will not allow predators who target our children to hide behind a keyboard or across the ocean.” Lawal faces up to life in prison, while the charge of child exploitation resulting in death alone carries a mandatory 30-year sentence. A court may also order he pay restitution for losses incurred by the Guffey family because of the scheme. Guffey said the scammer’s extortion attempts continued even after his son’s death. Anyone with the last name Guffey among Gavin’s Instagram followers started getting messages demanding money, he said. About two weeks after his son’s funeral, Guffey said he received a private Instagram message with a laughing emoji. Guffey and his younger son also got messages demanding money in exchange for not releasing Gavin’s nude photos. Guffey shared the messages with federal investigators, and they took control of the social media accounts and began communicating with the scammer — which eventually helped them learn his identity, he said. “They were able to pick up the conversation as agents to where he thought that he was talking to my 16-year-old. They were able to track him down, I think through that conversation and his continued efforts of trying to extort me as well,” he said. “This was a multifaceted operation. It wasn’t just one group. It started with our York County Sheriff’s Department, along with our South Carolina law enforcement division, tying in with FBI and Homeland Security.” Sextortion scams targeting kids have increased in recent years, the FBI says The FBI has warned that sexual extortion schemes are increasingly targeting underage boys and leading to an alarming increase in suicides nationwide. At the time of his son’s death, Guffey was running for state representative. After he was elected, he introduced a bill that criminalizes the type of scam that led to his son’s death. In 2023 South Carolina passed “Gavin’s Law,” which is named after his son and makes sextortion of minors and vulnerable people an aggravated felony. It also requires schools in the state to teach students about the dangers of sextortion and how to identify potential scammers. “Awareness really is 90% of the battle,” Guffey said. “We can talk until we are blue in the face, but I don’t care what type of parent you are, it’s very difficult to protect your children from everything.” Guffey has also sued Meta, Instagram’s parent company, for wrongful death, gross negligence and other claims, saying it does not do enough to protect children like Gavin from online predators. A Meta spokesperson told CNN  last year that teen safety is a big priority for the company and that it offers dozens of resources to help its young users stay safe.  Guffey’s lawsuit against the company is still pending. Guffey also is working with Cyber Dive, a company that has created a children’s smartphone with a nudity detection feature that shuts down the phone’s camera if male or female genitalia is detected. “The phone … allows parents to see every single action that their child has taken on social media, regardless of what app they’re on,” said Jeff Gottfurcht, CEO of Cyber Dive. “Anything the child does using that phone is sent in real time to a parent dashboard where parents get to see it.” Guffey said he wants to make sure no other parent suffers the same loss. “My mission in life, regardless of politics or anything else, is to protect kids until the day that I die,” he said.",

    "content": "We are all vulnerable to the rapid spread of phone scams – including, it seems, world leaders. Thailand’s prime minister has revealed she got a call from an AI system, demanding money in the voice of another famous head of government. Paetongtarn Shinawatra did not reveal who the computer was mimicking, but said she received a message in a voice identical to a well-known leader. “The voice was very clear, and I recognized it immediately. They first sent a voice clip, saying something like, ‘How are you? I want to work together,’ and so on,” Paetongtarn said. She said she later missed a call from the same number, then received a voice message which cut to the chase: “They sent another voice message asking for a donation, saying, ‘You are the only country in (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) that hasn’t donated yet,’ emphasizing it. I was taken aback for a moment and realized something was off.” She said whoever sent the message “probably used AI to take the voice” of the unnamed world leader. Scams or scam centers are not uncommon in Southeast Asia. In recent years, investigators say transnational crime organizations have exploited technological advances and the civil war in Myanmar to build a billion-dollar industry scamming people across the world. In January, a Chinese actor flew to Bangkok for what he thought was a casting call for a movie. Instead, he was picked up at the airport and driven to a scam center in Myanmar’s Myawaddy, a notorious cyber-fraud hub across the border from Thailand. This is also a problem for thousands of ordinary people who are lured to Thailand with the promise of white-collar jobs, before ultimately being trafficked to criminal hubs in Myanmar where they are held against their will and forced to steal millions in cryptocurrency. While many of the scams currently use phone calls and traditional messaging, there have been warnings that, as AI technology advances in leaps and bounds, millions of people could fall victim to scams using artificial intelligence to clone their voices. Last year, OpenAI, the maker of generative AI chatbot ChatGPT, unveiled its voice replication tool, Voice Engine, but didn’t make it available to the public at that stage, citing the “potential for synthetic voice misuse.” Paetongtarn, who began her political career in 2021 as the chief of the Pheu Thai’s party Inclusion and Innovation Advisory Committee, became prime minister in August 2024. She is the third member in her family’s political dynasty to serve as prime minister following her father and aunt, who served for five and three years respectively.",

    "content": "The urgent and overwhelming demand for N95 masks has created fertile ground for scammers to start leaking counterfeits into the supply chain and to make fake deals for product that doesn’t exist. Two leading N95 mask manufacturers have issued fraud warnings amid the coronavirus pandemic, saying they’ve received complaints about fraudsters trying to sell nonexistent product. And in one case, counterfeit masks have already made it to the front lines in the US.  Holy Name Medical Center in Teaneck, New Jersey, received a batch of 1,000 N95 masks a few weeks ago from a trusted longtime vendor, and determined they were fake. “We have a policy of having our clinicians test a small sample of medical equipment like masks before we give it to our staff,” said Jessica Griffin, the hospital’s director of public relations. “These masks did not fit the face area properly,” nor were they marked with a specific Centers for Disease Control and Prevention approval label as N95 masks are required to have. It was a shock for Holy Name, which is currently treating 144 patients for Covid-19 and has tested 1,440 people in total. “We’re the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in New Jersey,” Griffin said. Maintaining a consistent supply of PPE (personal protective equipment) like gowns and N95 masks for its doctors and nurses is crucial as the hospital continues to see a steady stream of patients. But across the world, N95 masks are in short supply, as they’re considered the gold standard of respirator masks. They’re able to filter out at least 95% of very small (0.3 micron) particles from the air, including bacteria and viruses – making them a crucial piece of equipment for doctors and nurses as they race to treat tens of thousands of coronavirus-infected patients in the United States.  That degree of protection is guaranteed, however, only with federally tested and certified masks that fit snugly around the nose and mouth – creating a seal to minimize the number of particles that bypass the filter through gaps between the user’s skin and the respirator, according to the CDC. Counterfeit respirators “can compromise the safety of anyone who uses them, including healthcare providers,” the CDC told CNN Business. Fortunately for the providers at Holy Name, the hospital’s testing procedures caught the counterfeit N95 masks, and they returned the batch to the vendor – who ultimately replaced them with 1,000 legitimate masks. Holy Name doesn’t fault the vendor. But major N95 manufacturers and procurement companies are also sounding the alarm. Leading manufacturers flag scams 3M, the world’s leading manufacturer of N95 masks, has received reports from healthcare customers of people selling counterfeit 3M products and falsely claiming associations with the company, the firm said in a letter last week to Attorney General William Barr. It warned about products with “missing straps, strange odors, blocked valves, misspelled words, etc.,” saying they are likely not authentic 3M respirators.” In the letter, 3M CEO Mike Roman also said the company is working with large online sellers and the authorities to identify and remove counterfeiters.  3M told CNN Business that while it hasn’t seen a large influx of counterfeit respirators onto the market, it is tracking a bigger issue of fraudsters trying to collect money in exchange for masks they don’t actually have. Prestige Ameritech, another top maker of N95 masks, has placed a “Fraud Alert warning” on its website saying its brand is also being used in “mask selling scams.” The company said it, too, is working with authorities on the matter. Prestige Ameritech did not respond to calls for further comment.  Suspect solicitations It’s not only manufacturers but also product sourcing firms who are dealing with potential N95 mask scams.  Premier Inc. –  a North Carolina-based company that helps procure PPE for 4,000 hospitals and 175,000 non-acute providers like surgical centers – recently received a strange call. A person posing as a “broker” offered Premier 500 million masks, saying they had access to the sizable inventory, said Chaun Powell, group vice president with Premier. The company promptly called 3M, who told Premier it would be impossible for anyone to have that many masks immediately available.  Meanwhile, scores of calls are pouring in. “Last week we received 10 to 20 solicitations from agents for millions of N95 masks. This week it’s 70 calls,” Powell said. Even as 3M and other makers ramp up production, Powell said immediate shortages have created opportunity for “questionable” mask products to seep into the supply chain. “We have already seen masks enter the supply chain that fail to meet basic testing parameters,” he said. He said Premier was aware of counterfeit N95 masks that showed the 3M logo incorrectly positioned on the packaging, for example. “We have no interest in creating fear and doubt in the market, but we are focused on protecting the integrity of the supplies that our nation’s dedicated caregivers and patients depend on,” said Powell. Supply chain experts say they aren’t surprised about fake masks popping up – and they expect the problem to accelerate. “There’s a high possibility of that because there’s quite a lot of money to be made on these masks,” said Rosemary Coates, executive director of the Reshoring Institute, a nonprofit manufacturing research and consultancy group that advocates for bringing overseas jobs back to America. Coates has 30 years of expertise in supply chain management and counterfeit products. When a product becomes very popular in a short time period – as the N95 mask has – individuals emerge is who identify themselves as “agents” or “brokers” trying to score lucrative deals by selling counterfeits at a premium, Coates said. These middlemen might not even have any inventory initially, she added. “They try to make a deal first with businesses that are trying to procure legitimate product, like the N95 mask. After they get a deal they then try to source the counterfeit version of the product.” “Anytime there is money to be made by selling products at a premium,” she said, “counterfeiters will jump into the market.”",

    "content": "Sicilian gangs persuaded drug addicts, alcoholics and people with mental health issues to have their limbs broken and then staged fake car accidents to get hundreds of thousands of euros as insurance payouts, according to police, who have broken up the scam.  Prosecutors in Palermo said 11 people, who were part of two connected criminal organizations, were arrested for taking part in the scheme that resulted in the January 2017 death of a Tunisian man during the staging of one of those accidents.  Gangsters picked their victims – mostly the young and vulnerable with histories of drug addiction, poverty, alcoholism and mental health issues – and with the promise of a wealthy insurance compensation crushed their arms and legs, police said in a statement that CNN obtained. The suspects often used 20-kilogram (44-pound) cast-iron weights similar to those in gyms, authorities said. A nurse at Civico hospital in Palermo is accused of providing anesthetics from her workplace to help those injured to cope with their pain.  Then the gang would stage a fake accident by hiring false witnesses and recovering the vehicles involved to cash in between 100,000 and 150,000 euros (about $116,000 to $174,000) from insurance payouts.  The victims, who were reduced to using wheelchairs or crutches after being seriously injured, received as little as a few hundred euros from the scheme, police said.  Rodolfo Ruperti, head of the Palermo police operations squad, told local media the gang lured about 20 people in three months into the scam.  “The victims were always a little complacent as in the first part of the scheme they would give their consent,” he said, “although we don’t know whether they were (of) sound mind.”",

    "content": "A key figure in the sprawling college admissions scam was sentenced to four months in prison Friday – the same day a former University of Southern California water polo coach was found guilty of conspiracy and fraud. Mark Riddell, 39, who helped wealthy parents buy their children’s way into universities, was also sentenced to two years of supervised release after his prison sentence. He was ordered to pay a $1,000 fine and submit to $239,449 in forfeiture, according to Caroline Ferguson, a spokeswoman for the US Attorney’s Office for Massachusetts.  Before the sentencing, former USC water polo coach Jovan Vavic was found guilty of conspiracy and fraud for soliciting and accepting bribes to facilitate admissions of students in the scam.  Riddell, a standardized test-taking savant, was paid to either ace SATs and ACTs in students’ place, or correct the students’ answers before they were handed in, prosecutors said. CNN has reached out to Riddell’s attorney for comment.  Riddell, one of many people caught up in the wider scheme in 2019, pleaded guilty that year to one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud, and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Authorities arrested and charged Riddell, dozens of parents, college coaches and administrators in the sprawling 2019 investigation known as “Operation Varsity Blues.”  Riddell agreed to a plea deal in 2019 that calls for incarceration at the low end of sentencing guidelines for the charges. Federal prosecutors have suggested a 33- to 41-month sentence, a law enforcement source told CNN that year. He had faced up to 20 years in prison. Prosecutors have said Riddell was associated with William “Rick” Singer, a former college admissions coach who masterminded the scam. Singer, prosecutors said, ran two general scams: First, to cheat on standardized tests for students whose parents paid; and second, to use Singer’s connections with college sports coaches and use bribes to get paying parents’ kids into school with fake athletic credentials. Riddell was a key player in the testing scam, prosecutors said. For years starting in 2011, Singer, the owner of a college prep business, bribed test administrators to let Riddell take tests in students’ place or correct students’ answers, prosecutors said. Singer would funnel money from a bogus charity, to which his clients donated, to test administrators at a Los Angeles private school and a public high school in Houston, authorities said.  Riddell was paid $10,000 per test, prosecutors said. “He was just a really smart guy,” Andrew Lelling, US Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, said at a March 2019 news conference. “He didn’t have any side information about the correct answers. He was just smart enough to get a near-perfect score on the exam or to calibrate the score.” Singer, who aided the investigation, pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy and other charges, and is awaiting sentencing.  ‘One of the largest scandals in the history of academia’ US Attorney for Massachusetts Rachael Rollins said her office is “grateful” for the verdict in the Vavic case, part of what she called “arguably one of the largest scandals in the history of academia.” “To say that the conduct in this case was reprehensible is an understatement,” Rollins said at a press conference. “The rich, powerful and famous, dripping with privilege and entitlement, used their money and clout to steal college admissions spots from more qualified and deserving students.” Vavic accepted bribes from Singer. Vavic was accused of designating certain USC applicants as water polo recruits, thereby facilitating their admission to the university, by relying on fake athletic resumes, in exchange for bribes. He was fired in March 2019 after his allegations of his involvement in the scam were made public. On Friday, Stephen Larson, an attorney representing Vavic, said they are “disappointed” with the jury’s decision finding Vavic guilty of all of the charges against him.  “We are disappointed with but respectful of the jury’s decision,” Larson said. Most people charged in ‘Operation Varsity Blues’ investigation have pleaded guilty The vast majority of those charged have pleaded guilty and served out their sentences, generally measured in weeks or months. Among the more high-profile parents charged in the test-taking portion of the scheme was actress Felicity Huffman, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud for paying $15,000 to the Singer to boost her older daughter’s test scores. Huffman spent 11 days in jail in 2019. Another actress, Lori Loughlin, spent two months in prison and her husband Mossimo Giannulli spent five months in prison for paying $500,000 to get their two daughters into the University of Southern California as fake recruited athletes.",

    "content": "Gavin Guffey sent a message to his younger brother and friends in the predawn hours of July 27 last year. It was short and cryptic: The heart-shaped symbol of love – &lt;3 – on a black background. Minutes later, in a hallway bathroom a few steps from his room, the 17-year-old fatally shot himself. His father, Brandon Guffey, says he was at their home in Rock Hill, South Carolina, when he heard a loud thud. It sounded like someone had slammed a bowling ball to the floor.  He rushed to the bathroom and found his oldest son bleeding on the floor between the tub and the toilet. For weeks, the grieving family searched for signs of anything they’d missed.  Then they found out that scammers masquerading as a young woman had sent Gavin nude photos – and asked him for similar images of himself. Once Gavin shared photos with them, they blackmailed him with a threat to publicize them if he didn’t pay.   Gavin had unwittingly become a victim of sexual extortion, or “sextortion,” a crime the FBI warns is increasingly targeting underage boys. Sextortion cases have gone up in the past year, federal officials said in a recent safety alert issued in partnership with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. The cases are contributing to an alarming number of suicides nationwide, the alert said. At the time of his son’s death, Guffey, 43, was running for state House representative. Six months later, after a winning campaign, he assumed office. His first order of business was to introduce a state bill to criminalize the type of scam that led to his son’s death. His fellow House lawmakers unanimously passed the bill last month. State senators passed the legislation Thursday – naming it “Gavin’s Law” – as a tearful Guffey watched from senate chambers.  Under the law, scammers who extort a minor or an at-risk adult will face up to 5 years in prison for a first offense.  Lawmakers are expected to send the bill soon to Gov. Henry McMaster to be signed into law.  For weeks, the family tried to unravel the mystery surrounding his death  Guffey and his wife, Melissa, have spent months trying to untangle the mystery surrounding their son’s death.   In the weeks after the funeral, the scammers barraged Guffey and his younger son, Coen, 16, with Instagram messages demanding money in exchange for the nude photos. One message, sent to Guffey’s Instagram inbox on August 20, the day Gavin would have turned 18, outraged him. “It said, ‘did I tell you your son begged for his life,’ with a laughing face emoji,” Guffey says. Law enforcement officials told him not to respond, but he says it took every ounce of strength he had to ignore it. He believes the scammers went through Gavin’s friends list on social media and sent messages to everyone with a similar last name, including Guffey’s nephew.   The family didn’t have access to Gavin’s computer and iPad – investigators took them as part of the probe into his death, Guffey says. He started piecing together his son’s final days using messages from the scammers and information shared by investigators. He discovered that the scammers used a vanish mode feature that deletes messages as soon as the recipient exits the chat.   “They used these disappearing messages. So the kids feel safe in the technology. What they don’t realize is, someone has another device recording that device,” he says.  Gavin had used Venmo to send the scammers $25 – all the money he had in his account – and pleaded for more time.  “He was telling them he would get them more money, please don’t send these images out … they didn’t care,” Guffey says. “I think in his mind it was just too much, and he didn’t know how he would overcome that.” In an email to CNN, an FBI spokesperson in Columbia, South Carolina, said no arrests have been made in the case. It declined to provide additional information, citing an ongoing investigation.   Sextortion targets thousands of teens every year, the FBI says Sextortion schemes happen primarily online.  In 2022, law enforcement agencies received over 7,000 reports related to the online sextortion of minors, federal officials say. Nearly half of those resulted in victims, a majority of them boys. Over a dozen of the sextortion victims died by suicide, the FBI says.  Predators typically trick their young male victims into believing they are talking to girls their own age, persuade them to send explicit photos and videos, and threaten to release those images if a payment is not sent.  Young people are more impulsive because they don’t weigh risks and consequences the same way adults do, says Dr. Carl Fleisher, an expert in adolescent and child psychiatry, in an article on UCLA Health. Their judgment and decision-making abilities are underdeveloped because the prefrontal cortex — the brain’s executive control center — is not fully developed until the mid-20s, Fleisher says.   “This crime starts when young people believe they are communicating with someone their own age who is interested in a relationship …” the FBI says. “The shame, fear, and confusion children feel when they are caught in this cycle often prevents them from asking for help or reporting the abuse.”  On its website, the FBI reminds teens that scammers prey on their fear. It urged them to report sextortions because they’re not the ones committing a crime.  Sextortion scams have increasingly made headlines nationwide. But law enforcement is fighting back. Mark Totten, a US attorney for the western district of Michigan, announced this month that three men will be extradited from Nigeria for allegedly extorting teenage boys. One of the men will be charged with causing the death of Jordan DeMay, 17, who died by suicide in March 2022 as a result of sextortion.   And in December police in Los Angeles arrested a suspect in the case of 17-year-old Ryan Last, who killed himself in February 2022 in San Jose, California, hours after being victimized by a similar sextortion scam.   Guffey’s son was a free spirit who liked to prank his dad  Guffey knows all too well the emotional toll sextortion takes on families. Nearly a year later, he’s still struggling with what happened at his home that morning.  He recalls cradling his son, thinking he’d fallen and hit his head while in the bathroom. He remembers catching a glimpse of his pistol on the floor, and smelling the gunpowder. He says he’ll never forget his pain and confusion when he realized his son had died by suicide.  “I was a basket case, I didn’t know what to do,” he says. “My initial thought was, this is my fault – I left the gun out.”  Gavin loved skating and art, and had stickers of dinosaurs and his favorite characters – Spider-Man and Deadpool – plastered on his car’s dashboard.  The day he died, a package addressed to him arrived in the mail. Gavin had ordered a flag with a face of rapper Ye – formerly known as Kanye West –  against a backdrop of black and gold colors. It had the words, “Don’t tread on Ye” on it. Guffey chuckles at the memory.  “Gavin would constantly troll me. I’m a pretty conservative guy, and Gavin was more of a liberal kid,” he says. “But I always encourage my kids to think on their own, and to be their own person. As long as they’re thinking, that’s what’s most important.” The flag hangs in his office. It’s a conversation starter that always leads to discussions about his son – and the dangers that sextortion scams pose to teens.  Guffey describes sextortion as a lucrative crime that has attracted international fraudsters and local scammers alike. “If you can extort 10 teenage boys that aren’t gonna say anything for $100 each, and do all that with one image that you got from a girl, it’s fairly simple,” he says. “And teenage boys, whenever they see they’re getting that attention (from a girl), they’re not necessarily thinking.”  He has a message to other teens: Tomorrow needs you  Guffey briefly considered quitting his role as a state representative to try and hunt down the scammers.  “My wife said, ‘absolutely not. You’re one of the few people that have a voice that can get out there and truly make a difference,’ ” he says. “And at that point, I had to decide: Is it more important to focus my effort into finding the individual that’s responsible for my son’s death? Or is it more important to spread the message and keep another family from having to feel this pain?” He’s made the latter a major part of his legislative platform. He’s tattooed his son’s last message on his left arm. Every time his fellow House legislators signed his bill, he gave them a lapel pin with a similar symbol.   On days when Guffey needed a boost of strength, he’d slip into Gavin’s white Vans. The sneakers, scribbled with black lines and a Spider-Man doodle, made him feel like he could handle anything.  “I feel like he (Gavin) would want me trying to save additional kids from ever having to feel the way that he felt at that time,” he says. Guffey’s goal, he says, is to make sextortion scammers think twice before they target children in South Carolina.  At Gavin’s funeral, his friends put stickers of his favorite comic book characters on his casket. They also went to his favorite skate park and spray-painted a rock with a dinosaur and the &lt;3 symbol, along with a message for other young people: “Tomorrow Needs You.”   Guffey says he hopes teenagers will remember that message whenever they face challenges.

    "content": "For 87 years, the Murdaugh family name came to represent a legal dynasty in coastal South Carolina, where three successive generations controlled the local prosecutor’s office. But now, the family has been closely connected to a bloody tragedy, allegations of embezzlement and a bizarre murder-for-hire plot to score millions in life insurance. The allegations center around the actions of Alex Murdaugh, 54, who stood trial for the 2021 murders of his wife and son. He was found guilty in March 2023 in a closely watched case that comes with a potential life sentence. In addition, Murdaugh, an attorney who has since been disbarred, has been charged with 99 financial crimes related to a wide-ranging scheme to bilk his law firm, clients and the government out of about $9.3 million, according to the state attorney general. So what were the twists and turns that led to this point? Here’s a timeline of everything we know about the Murdaugh family saga:  1920-2006 Over three generations, a member of the Murdaugh family has served as the 14th Circuit Solicitor, which leads prosecutions for Allendale, Beaufort, Colleton, Hampton and Jasper counties in the southern part of South Carolina. Randolph Murdaugh Sr. was elected to the 14th Circuit Solicitor’s Office in 1920 and served in the position until his death in 1940. His son, Randolph Murdaugh Jr., then took over the position and served until his retirement in 1986. Murdaugh Jr.’s son, Randolph Murdaugh III, was then elected to the role in 1987 and served through the end of 2005. Murdaugh III’s son, Alex Murdaugh, works as an attorney at the law firm Peters Murdaugh Parker Eltzroth & Detrick, known as PMPED. In 2006, then-Gov. Mark Sanford appoints attorney Duffie Stone to serve as the 14th Circuit Solicitor, making him the first non-Murdaugh in the position. He has been elected to the position four times since, most recently in 2020, according to the solicitor’s website. 2018 Gloria Satterfield, a longtime housekeeper for the Murdaugh family, dies in what is described as a “trip and fall accident” at the Murdaugh home, according to attorney Eric Bland, who is representing her estate. After Satterfield’s death, a $500,000 wrongful death claim was filed against Alex Murdaugh on behalf of her estate, Bland said. 2019 A boat crashes at a bridge near Parris Island in Beaufort County, South Carolina, on February 24, killing 19-year-old Mallory Beach, according to the South Carolina Attorney General in documents obtained by CNN. Six people were on board the boat at the time of the crash, including Alex Murdaugh’s 19-year-old son, Paul. Murdaugh owns the boat. Stone, the solicitor, recuses himself from the case because of personal connections. Paul Murdaugh is indicted in April on charges of boating under the influence (BUI) causing great bodily harm and causing death in connection to the crash, court records show. He pleads not guilty. Summer 2021 June 7: The chief financial officer at Alex Murdaugh’s namesake law firm PMPED confronts him about $792,000 in missing funds. That night, Murdaugh calls 911 and reports he found his wife Margaret (known as Maggie), 52, and son Paul, then 22, shot dead outside of their home in Islandton, a small community about an hour north of Hilton Head Island, according to the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED). Murdaugh tells officers on the scene he was not at the crime scene that night. He says he had visited his ailing mother in Almeda and returned to find his wife and son dead. June 10: Randolph Murdaugh III dies peacefully at his home at age 81, according to his obituary. June 15: SLED releases basic information about the June 7 killings, saying Alex Murdaugh called 911 at 10:07 p.m. and investigators collected evidence that night and the next morning. June 17: Alex Murdaugh’s brothers, John Marvin Murdaugh and Randolph “Randy” Murdaugh IV, speak to “Good Morning America” about the killings. They say Alex called them “distraught” with the news that his wife and son had been shot. They say they do not believe their brother is involved. June 22: SLED reopens an investigation into the unsolved death of 19-year-old Stephen Smith, whose body was found on the road in 2015 in Hampton County. The agency says the probe is being reopened based on information gathered while investigating the deaths of Maggie and Paul Murdaugh. June 25: Alex Murdaugh and his other son, Buster, announce a $100,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of the person or persons responsible for the killings of Maggie and Paul. July 22: SLED releases redacted audio of Alex Murdaugh’s 911 call the night of the killings. In the audio, a distraught Murdaugh advises dispatchers his wife and son had been shot, are on the ground and are not breathing. August 11: An investigator with SLED sharply questions Murdaugh and intimates he is a suspect in the killings. Murdaugh again denies killing them. Stone, the solicitor, writes a letter to South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson saying he intends to recuse himself from the Murdaugh death investigations, CNN affiliate WCSC-TV reports. September 2021 September 3: Alex Murdaugh resigns from the law firm PMPED, according to the firm. September 4: Murdaugh calls 911 and reports he was shot early Saturday afternoon on a road in Hampton County, according to a SLED spokesman. He was taken to a hospital in Savannah, Georgia, where he was treated for a “superficial gunshot wound to the head,” the statement said. September 6: Murdaugh releases a statement through his attorney, Dick Harpootlian, to WCSC saying he is resigning from the law firm and entering rehab. Murdaugh’s other attorney, Jim Griffin, says his client has an opioid addiction. September 7: The law firm says Murdaugh resigned “after the discovery by PMPED that Alex misappropriated funds in violation of PMPED standards and policies.” September 8: The South Carolina Supreme Court issues an order suspending Alex Murdaugh’s license to practice law in the state. September 10: A family spokesperson issues a statement about Alex Murdaugh’s shooting that indicates the injury was more serious than a superficial wound. The spokesperson also says an unknown person was to blame. “Alex pulled over after seeing a low tire indicator light. A male driver in a blue pickup asked him if he had car troubles, as soon as Alex replied, he was shot,” the statement said. September 13: SLED releases a statement announcing it has opened an investigation into Alex Murdaugh for allegedly misappropriating funds at his law firm. September 14: Court documents allege Murdaugh’s roadside shooting was part of an arrangement in which he hired a former client to kill him so that Murdaugh’s surviving son could collect a life insurance payout of about $10 million. Curtis Edward Smith, 61, who allegedly shot Murdaugh, was charged with assisted suicide, assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature, pointing and presenting a firearm, insurance fraud and conspiracy to commit insurance fraud, according to SLED. September 15: SLED announces it is opening a criminal investigation into the February 2018 death of Gloria Satterfield, a housekeeper for the Murdaugh family, and the handling of her estate.  September 16: Alex Murdaugh is arrested in connection to an insurance fraud scheme that court documents say involved Murdaugh arranging for his own killing. He is charged with insurance fraud, conspiracy to commit insurance fraud and filing a false police report, according to a law enforcement statement. September 22: Connor Cook, a survivor of the 2019 boat crash, files a lawsuit against Murdaugh claiming the former attorney attempted to orchestrate a campaign to falsely blame him for the crash. Cook also alleges that Murdaugh should have been aware that his underage son, Paul, had alcohol issues and should not have been allowed to use his boat. September 26: The PMPED law firm issues a statement claiming Murdaugh “lied and stole from us.” The firm says no member was aware of “Alex’s scheme” or his drug addiction. September 28: The children of Gloria Satterfield, the Murdaugh family housekeeper who died in 2018, file a motion for Murdaugh’s arrest and detention until the money he allegedly embezzled from her estate is returned. The estate has not received any of the money owed as the result of a 2018 civil settlement, the estate’s attorney says. October 2021 October 6: Murdaugh’s law firm announces it is suing him to recover funds he allegedly stole from clients for his own personal use, according to a statement from the firm. October 14: After being released from a drug rehabilitation center, Alex Murdaugh is arrested in Orlando, Florida, on suspicion of misappropriating settlement funds in connection with Gloria Satterfield’s 2018 death, authorities said.  He is charged with two felony counts of obtaining property by false pretenses, according to SLED.  October 16: A pair of affidavits are released that allege Alex Murdaugh coordinated with the family of Gloria Satterfield, his former housekeeper, to sue himself for insurance money that he then pocketed for himself.  October 26: Attorneys for the estate of Gloria Satterfield, the Murdaugh’s housekeeper, say they’ve reached a settlement with his former law firm. November 2021 November 12: Alex Murdaugh cites privilege against self-incrimination in declining to respond to allegations by his former law firm that he converted firm and client money to his own personal use, according to court filings. November 19: South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson’s Office announces a state grand jury has issued five indictments with a total of 27 charges against Alex Murdaugh alleging he defrauded and laundered almost $5 million. The indictments include four counts of breach of trust with fraudulent intent; seven counts of obtaining signature or property by false pretenses; seven counts of money laundering; eight counts of computer crimes; and one count of forgery. December 2021 December 10: Seven indictments with another 21 criminal charges are filed against Murdaugh for allegedly defrauding victims of millions of dollars, according to the state attorney general. December 14: Murdaugh agrees to a $4.3 million settlement with the family of Gloria Satterfield, his former housekeeper, according to family attorney Eric Bland. 2022 January 21: Alex Murdaugh is charged with 23 more crimes in four new indictments returned by a grand jury, the state attorney general said. The fresh indictments allege Murdaugh stole more than $2.2 million meant for four clients. The new charges include 19 counts of breach of trust with fraudulent intent and four counts of computer crimes. March 16: Murdaugh is indicted on four more crimes, including conspiracy and false statement or misrepresentation in an insurance transaction, related to a scheme to defraud multiple insurance companies, according to the attorney general. June 3: South Carolina law enforcement officials announce they sought and received permission from the family of Gloria Satterfield, Murdaugh’s housekeeper, to exhume her remains. The exhumation stems from a Hampton County coroner’s request that led to the state law enforcement division opening a criminal investigation into Satterfield’s death. “The decedent’s death was not reported to the Coroner at the time, nor was an autopsy performed. On the death certificate the manner of death was ruled ‘Natural,’ which is inconsistent with injuries sustained in a trip and fall accident,” the coroner’s request to the law enforcement division said. June 28: Murdaugh and former acquaintance Curtis Smith are indicted on two counts of criminal conspiracy by a state grand jury, according to the attorney general. The indictment alleges Murdaugh gave Smith hundreds of checks over a number of years totaling about $2.4 million.

July 12: The South Carolina Supreme Court disbars Alex Murdaugh, according to an order released by the court.

December 16: Murdaugh is indicted on nine counts of tax evasion for failing to report more than $6.9 million in income he earned through illegal acts, the attorney general says. 2023 January 25: Murdaugh’s trial for the murders of his wife Maggie and son Paul begins in Walterboro, South Carolina. In opening statements, prosecutor Creighton Waters says Murdaugh killed his family as a “gathering storm” was set to expose his vast financial crimes. Defense attorney Dick Harpootlian says the state’s accusations are filled with “theories” and “conjecture.” February 1: Prosecutors play video taken by Paul Murdaugh on the night of the murders in which Alex Murdaugh’s voice can be heard in the background, contradicting his claim that he was not at the crime scene that night. March 2: After weeks of testimony in the murder trial, jurors deliberated for less than three hours before returning guilty verdicts on all four charges Murdaugh was facing – two counts of murder and two counts of possession of a weapon in the commission of a violent crime.",

    "content": "“Shark Tank” judge Barbara Corcoran is “thrilled” about getting back nearly $400,000 after it was stolen in an elaborate email scam. Corcoran said last week that a phishing scam swindled her out of $388,700. The scammer tricked her bookkeeper into wiring the money by using an email address that was similar to her assistant’s, requesting a payment for a renovation.  The millionaire investor said in a statement Monday that she had “already accepted” that she had lost the money and “moved on.”  “I really thought it was a goner,” she said.  In a twist of good fortune, she said that the German-based bank the bookkeeper used to wire the money froze the transfer before it was deposited into the scammer’s bank account in China. Corcoran said her bank asked the German bank to freeze the transaction so her team could prove it was a fraud.  More than 114,000 people reported being a victim of that type of scam last year. Together they reported nearly $60 million in losses, according to the FBI’s 2019 Internet Crime Report. Phishing attacks are common methods of stealing usernames, passwords and money.

    "content": "First it was Chinese tourists apparently being targeted by criminal gangs in Paris. Roma pickpocketing crews were reportedly picking on Chinese travelers because of their habit of carrying plenty of cash with them. Now the tables seem, in a way, to be turned. French authorities suspect Chinese organized criminals to be behind the circulation of thousands of fake tickets to Paris’ Louvre – the world’s most visited art gallery – in a scam worth hundreds of thousands of euros. The museum was alerted to the swindle at the beginning of August when a staff member became suspicious of a ticket handed over by a Chinese tour guide, France 24 reports. The ticket “felt strange to the touch and the paper quality was not good. All our staff were immediately put on the alert,” a Louvre spokesperson told Le Parisien. Upping their game But the criminals behind the scam appear to have upped their game at some point – or more than one gang is operating. Days later, the Louvre discovered fake tickets that at first appeared “in every way identical to the genuine article,” the spokesperson said. Then, at the end of August, Belgian customs officers seized more than 4,000 forged Louvre passes in a parcel from China. The counterfeit tickets being worth at least €36 ($48) each, that haul alone would have saved the scammers at least €144,000 (about $191,000). Read more: Chinese tourists targeted in Paris pickpocketing spate  The Belgian discovery has sparked a French criminal investigation into whether criminal gangs in China are collaborating with Chinese tour operators in Paris to profit from the fake tickets, the Louvre said. However, French officials are reportedly wary of commenting publicly on the investigation for fear of causing diplomatic embarrassment with China. Scope of scam uncertain The Louvre as yet has no idea of the scope of the scam.  “Our tickets are valid for a year. There’s no telling how many are in circulation and there’s no way as yet of calculating the cost of this scam to the museum,” the Louvre said. The gallery would “enhance [its] anti-counterfeiting system” in response to the forgeries, the gallery told the Beijing Times, emphasizing that it continued to welcome Chinese tourists. French diplomats may be right to tread warily around the incident. Comments on Chinese social media expressed concern about the damage the scam could do to China’s image. “Can you please stop forging? This is so embarrassing!” read one post on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter (link in Chinese language only). “Ticket holders may not know the tickets are fake – yet Chinese people are the ones being shamed,” read another.",

    "content": "It’s a tactic known to law enforcement as “fishing” – women troll upscale bars and restaurants to pick up wealthy men for “dates.” But for four men in New York City, it was anything but dinner and a movie.  Four female adult entertainers and a strip club manager were charged this week in an alleged scheme that involved spiking the men’s drinks, taking them to gentlemen’s clubs, then charging tens of thousands of dollars to their credit cards, according to prosecutors. The four women – identified as Samantha Barbash, Karina Pascucci, Marsi Rosen and Roselyn Keo  – pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy, grand larceny, assault and forgery. Carmine Vitolo, a manager at RoadHouse NYC Gentlemen’s Club, pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy, grand larceny and tampering with evidence.  The victims were described as professional men working in the medical, financial and legal fields. None of them is named in the indictment filed in State Supreme Court in New York City. Authorities said substances – including ketamine, a tranquilizer, methylone or “molly,” and cocaine – were slipped into the men’s drinks.  The victims, under the influence of drugs, would then be transported to one of two strip clubs in Manhattan and Queens, where they were “taken to a private room for adult entertainment,” according to the prosecutor’s office. The prosecutor’s office said Barbash and Keo would consult Vitolo and oversee the financial part of the scheme —charging $5,000 to over $50,000 on individual or even multiple credit cards, a news release says.  The men’s signatures were then forged, or the men were led to believe the charges were significantly less as they signed the bill. One victim had more than $100,000 in fraudulent charges rung up over the course of three nights, the prosecutor’s office said. Some victims woke up in their beds with no knowledge of visiting a club the night before, the release added. Sam Gregory, the attorney for defendant Keo, said the nights in question unfolded differently. “It sounds like some guys went out, got drunk, spent more money than they were supposed to and now claim they got taken advantage of,” Gregory said. New York City Special Narcotics Prosecutor Bridget G. Brennan disagreed. “The defendants were banking on the victims being too afraid to contact the police, but as the indictment and arrests show, they made a serious miscalculation,” she said. While the charges mentioned in the indictment add up to approximately $200,000 swiped between September and December 2013, agents believe similar criminal activity may date to as early as 2011, the release says.

    "content": "A former NFL player and his mother have been indicted in a scheme to steal more than $690,000 by fraudulently obtaining five home equity loans in six days, according to the New Jersey Attorney General’s Office.   Irving Fryar, 51, and his mother, Allene McGhee, 72, were charged with second-degree conspiracy and theft by deception in New Jersey Superior Court Wednesday.    The indictment alleges that Fryar schemed with McGhee to obtain five home equity loans totaling more than $690,000 between December 16 and 21, 2009, using McGhee’s Willingboro home as collateral for all of the loans. The pair allegedly deceived five banks by acquiring the loans within six days and purposefully failing to disclose the existence of any other loans.   The indictment further charges that McGhee’s loan applications falsely claimed that she earned thousands of dollars a month as an event coordinator for her son’s church, New Jerusalem House of God in Burlington County. Fryar himself allegedly received or spent more than $200,000 of the fraudulently obtained loan proceeds, the attorney general’s office said.   Fryar and McGhee made only a few payments on four of the loans, and those banks eventually wrote the loans off as losses, authorities said.   “This is not a case in which Mr. Fryar and his mother simply omitted or misstated information on loan applications,” said acting Attorney General John Hoffman. “This indictment alleges that they engaged in an elaborate criminal scheme that was designed to defraud these banks of hundreds of thousands of dollars.” Neither Fryar nor McGhee responded to CNN’s requests for comment. It is unclear whether either has hired an attorney.   A court date has not yet been set, according to the attorney general’s office.   Between 1984 and 2000, Fryar played for four NFL teams: the New England Patriots, the Miami Dolphins, the Philadelphia Eagles and the Washington Redskins.  He is the head football coach at Robbinsville High School in Robbinsville, New Jersey.",

    "content": "A Bronx woman accused of a charity scam after the Connecticut school shooting was indicted Tuesday on charges of scheming to defraud and identity theft, according to prosecutors. Nouel Alba, 37, is accused of falsely claiming to be an aunt of Noah Pozner, one of the 20 schoolchildren killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown in December, the Bronx District Attorney’s Office said in a news release. On a Facebook page, she posted photos of Noah and solicited donations to pay for his funeral, the statement said. Donors sent $240 to a PayPal account between December 14 and 20, the statement said.  Alba was arrested at her home and was arraigned by Judge Martin Marcus, who set bail at $10,000, the district attorney’s office said. Alba’s attorney, Justine Olderman, was not immediately available for comment Tuesday.  The charges of scheming to defraud and identity theft carry sentences of up to four years in prison after conviction. Alba was indicted and charged on December 27 with one count of making false statements to federal agents. That charge carries a maximum term of five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000, prosecutors said.  Alba denied being involved in a scam during an appearance on CNN’s Anderson Cooper 360 in December.  “This says – this has your e-mail on it. Right there,” said CNN investigative producer David Fitzpatrick. “This is about Noah Pozner’s funeral.” “I never sent that,” Alba replied. Later in the interview, Alba identified one of her e-mail accounts presented by Fitzpatrick. “Yeah, that’s one of my Gmails. …Yeah, my personal account,” she said during the interview. “But I never set up any funds for anybody.” CNN reports spurred the Bronx district attorney’s investigation, its news release said. Noah, 6, 19 other children and six adults were shot to death at the Newtown school on December 14. The gunman, Adam Lanza, 20, killed himself after the rampage.",

    "content": "It sounded like a good deal: Get a Cuban birth certificate and stay in the United States, worry-free. But federal authorities say the birth certificates weren’t legitimate, and the undocumented immigrants trying to get them weren’t Cuban. Now a federal judge in Florida has sentenced several people for conspiring to commit immigration fraud. The defendants, authorities say, made more than half a million dollars selling forged Cuban birth certificates to undocumented immigrants and helping them fill out fraudulent U.S. immigration forms. Their aim, investigators said, was to exploit a U.S. law that allows Cuban immigrants to apply for permanent residence if they’ve been in the United States for more than a year. Authorities arrested Nelson Daniel Silvestri Soutto, Laura Maria Ponce Santos, Amelia Osorio and Fidel Morejon Vega last year. Court documents show that all four have pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit immigration fraud.  New immigration rules help undocumented families Court documents provide details about a type of scam that’s becoming increasingly common, immigration lawyers say. In one conversation with a confidential informant recorded by investigators, Morejon demanded thousands of dollars in payment for Cuban birth certificates and provided advice about how to answer questions from immigration authorities who might ask why he has a Mexican accent. “‘Uh, because I work with a lot of Mexicans and I caught it (the accent) …’” period,” Morejon said, according to a transcript of the conversation filed in federal court. “You are Cuban … from today on … 3:25 in the afternoon you are entering the United States and you are Cuban.” Morejon advised the informant and an undercover officer not to make conversation with officials, and to tell them they arrived “in a raft,” according to the transcript. Investigators describe Morejon as the scheme’s ringleader, accusing him of recruiting the others and paying them referral fees for each undocumented immigrant who purchased his services. Opinion: Solve immigration without a quick path to citizenship He “met with numerous illegal aliens and told them that he could assist them in obtaining their residency in the United States by pretending to be Cuban,” according to a court document filed along with Morejon’s guilty plea agreement last year. “To effectuate the fraud, Morejon posed as an immigration officer to impress the illegal aliens (and) also threatened some of the illegal aliens with deportation,” the document said.  The day authorities arrested him, they found blank Cuban birth certificates and altered naturalization certificates in his Florida home, federal prosecutors said in a memo filed this month. In addition to selling fake Cuban birth certificates, Morejon also sold fraudulent presidential pardons, prosecutors said.  Morejon, of Kissimmee, Florida, is scheduled to be sentenced later this month. Prosecutors have asked the judge to sentence him to more than three years in prison. “The full extent of Morejon’s fraud remains unknown as his former customers continue to be identified by the government,” prosecutors said. “The one conclusion that must be drawn from all the facts is that Morejon devoted his life, over a period of more than three and a half years, to extracting as much money as possible from his customers and obtaining that money by whatever means necessary.” U.S. District Judge Cecilia M. Altonaga sentenced Ponce earlier this month to six months in prison, two years on parole and nine months under house arrest. Osorio was sentenced Thursday to four months in prison, two years of parole and 11 months under house arrest. And Silvestri was sentenced to a year in prison, three years on parole and nine months under house arrest. Morejon pleaded guilty “and acknowledged he was the organizer,” said Hugo Rodriguez, an attorney representing Morejon. That means he’ll likely receive a higher sentence, Rodriguez said. Attorney Richard Serafini, who represents Osorio, declined to comment but referred to a memo he filed in court earlier this month, arguing for a lower sentence. The memo argues that Osorio, 61, paid Morejon thousands of dollars for a fraudulent presidential pardon for her son, who had been convicted of a federal drug offense.  She became involved in the conspiracy “through her efforts to help her son” and her criminal conduct was an “extreme aberration,” Serafini wrote. “Her background is one of hard work, dedication to her family and, until this episode, law-abiding,” the memo said. Attorneys for Ponce and Silvestri did not respond to requests for comment. This type of scam has been happening in Florida for years but appears to be on the rise, immigration attorney Wilfredo Allen said. There are consequences beyond this particular case, according to Maite Hoyos, an immigration attorney in Miami. More and more, she said, authorities are asking her Cuban clients to prove the validity of their birth certificates – something, she says, that suggests that this type of fraud is on investigators’ radar.",

    "content": "A former Southern California doctor is back in the US from Israel to serve his sentence for a $50 million plastic surgery insurance scam, the Department of Justice said. Dr. David M. Morrow, 75, arrived at Los Angeles International Airport on Thursday escorted by US Marshals. The next day, he was ordered to start his 20-year sentence in federal prison.  The former resident of  Rancho Mirage was sentenced in absentia in 2017 after he and his wife fled to Israel following his guilty plea to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and filing a false tax return.  Prosecutors said he ran a scheme that duped health insurance companies into paying tens of millions of dollars for cosmetic procedures with false claims that they were medically necessary.  Israel deported Linda Morrow, 67,  in July, and she is facing a 31-count grand jury indictment , the statement said. She served as executive director of The Morrow Institute, and allegedly participated in the scheme, federal officials said.  With procedures like tummy tucks, nose jobs and breasts augmentations, the couple submitted millions of dollars in insurance claims by labeling the cosmetic procedures as “medically necessary,” the statement said.  Sometimes, court documents said, patients underwent procedures they did not want in exchange for promises that Morrow would perform the cosmetic procedures they really wanted, officials said.  Other times, Morrow performed procedures on patients without their consent and with “ongoing medical problems or disfigurement.” Evidence showed that Morrow even paid a patient for undergoing surgeries that would be billed to insurance, the statement said. Before they fled, David Morrow pleaded guilty to the charges against him. The Morrows did not report to the court that they sold their Beverly Hills home for $9.45 million and also transferred $4 million to Israeli bank accounts, court records show. Using fraudulent Mexican passports under different names, the couple fled to Israel and applied for citizenship. FBI agents determined that they used an Israeli attorney to try to launder more than $2 million, according to court documents. Linda Morrow is scheduled to appear in court June 16 on a separate case of contempt of court.   She  faces the contempt of court case for allegedly fleeing the United States while free on bond in the health care fraud case. ",

No one really knows where anybody is,” Nessel said, noting she’s had several friends die from the virus in Michigan, where the number of deaths is already around 1,600, according to a John Hopkins University tally. “It’s so easy to prey upon people when they are literally scared for their lives.” Scams attempting to fleece vulnerable Americans out of money are already thriving as the pandemic consumes the country – and it’s only the beginning of what may be years of prank phone calls and millions of dollars in swindles, according to several state attorneys general and officials from the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice. Law enforcement at every level of government is left playing whack-a-mole as scammers have tried to make money off of nearly every aspect of the pandemic. The scams are wide-ranging, from reselling medical supplies and toilet paper at markups, to pressuring emotionally vulnerable people for payments, even to trying to dupe the federal government. There are nearly 142 open investigations relating to hoarding or price-gouging nationwide, with many more fraud investigations underway in every US Attorney’s Office in the country, according to Scott Brady, US Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania. And the FTC, the main national agency that tracks and responds to alleged consumer scams, has already collected almost 17,000 complaints from all 50 states related to coronavirus, according to data the agency released Sunday. Almost half of the complaints from consumers say they’ve lost money, at a midpoint of about $570 lost per reported scam. So far, most consumer complaints to the FTC involve travel and vacations where people seek refunds. But the reports of government and business impostors are growing by the day, according to daily updates the agency releases. “We’ve already seen text messaging offers where people are saying, ‘Let me help you get access to government grant money,’” Monica Vaca, a consumer response director at the FTC, told CNN. “That is what I expect is coming in a big wave of complaints.” With some of the first IRS payments going out this week, the Justice Department, too, is preparing for a flood of fraudsters, trying to get a cut of government-provided relief funds. Given the large size of the government Covid-19 relief programs – provided through the $2 trillion stimulus approved by Congress – federal law enforcement expects the amount of attempted fraud will be larger than past aid programs such as those following the 2008 economic crisis, a senior Justice Department official said.  The FTC was still shutting down financial hoaxers that targeted consumers years after the 2009 stimulus, Vaca said, and stimulus-related coronavirus scams may last just as long. “This is not the type of fraud situation that will last a short period of time – like we see with hurricanes,” she said.  Federal money fraudsters  Among the frauds that officials are looking for are businesses that fake the number of employees they have or how well they were doing before the pandemic. In extreme cases, some fraudsters will invent entire fake businesses to apply for aid, trying to get money directly from the government.  Others will target consumers by offering to help them claim money from the federal government for a fee. The attorney general of New Jersey warned his state – one of the hardest hit by the virus – that scam artists are sending out phishing emails and text messages about the stimulus that prompt people to click on a link and provide their personal information.  In some situations, the messages contain malware that can install software onto a person’s computer that could access financial account info. In other situations, the fake links look like they’re from the US Small Business Administration or other agencies and ask people to apply for fake grants, the New Jersey Attorney General’s Office said this weekend. To avoid the scammers targeting the government directly, Justice Department officials say they’ve worked with the agencies administering the congressionally approved aid to design applications and forms that protect the taxpayer funding, allowing for prosecutors to bring false statement charges against those who lie in their requests for money. The business grants and loans programs are being administered by banks, which could help guard against fraud. But the need to move money quickly presents more challenges for fraud prevention.  “The faster you move to provide resources to affected individuals and companies, the more you open yourself up to the possibility of fraud,” said Brian Benczkowski, assistant attorney general for the criminal division. Already, prosecutors are working on bringing charges in some of the earliest cases that have emerged, Benczkowski said. The idea is to try to warn people who want to commit fraud that they will be caught. Phone calls, text messages and tips Scam calls and texts are already lighting up Americans’ phones across the country. One person in Erie, Pennsylvania, wrote to the Federal Trade Commission about a phone call claiming the government was issuing free face masks. A few others from New Jersey told the FTC about calls claiming to be from testing labs offering Covid-19 screening for a triple-digit fee, according to information about the complaints that the agency has released.  Pennsylvania’s tip line has received more than 4,000 reports of price gouging, including one from Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney about an overpriced item he saw in his local grocery store, according to Jacklin Rhoads, the spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania attorney general. The office has seen a wide range of fraud so far, from false advertising for test kits and face masks online, to price gouging and phishing attempts. In Washington, DC, where coronavirus cases were accelerating last week, the city’s attorney general, Karl Racine, sent investigators to look into corner stores and small convenience stores after complaints came in about marked-up items for sale. The office has sent more than a dozen cease-and-desist letters as of last week, and had also noticed scam phone calls and texts offering discounts on utility payments, Racine said.  In order to fight the consumer aspect of fraud, Racine and attorneys general from almost every state have gone on public relations tours to inform their states’ residents about what may be a scam. Racine said communities in metro areas like DC that face poverty are often the ones least likely to report scams, while certain populations are already more vulnerable to them. Racine and other consumer protection officials, for instance, have taken part in several recent telephone town halls hosted by AARP to spread the word that people who are contacted shouldn’t give out their credit card information. Hosted by both local chapters and the national organization, the weekly AARP calls, which have drawn more than 80,000 listeners, have been a cornerstone of the approach to educate people, especially older Americans who may be targeted more by scammers, officials at both the state and federal level have said.  In another educational approach, the FTC, which looks at thousands of consumer complaints related to coronavirus and other topics, has been sharing a bingo-card graphic online since March 24 to encourage people to look for different types of Covid-19 scams.  The graphic has cartoon drawings of the virus, with bingo squares filled with possibilities like “Get health insurance” and “Covid-19 cure!” Taking scammers to court  The Justice Department, too, has been highlighting criminal cases it’s brought against people hoarding medical supplies. Attorney General William Barr spoke about potential scams during a White House press conference in recent weeks.  In the first federal case resulting from a Department of Justice task force, prosecutors charged a Brooklyn man after they found him selling enough medical gear to outfit an entire hospital at marked-up prices. “Speed is a big thing here because we know that the material that is being hoarded is something that is desperately needed,” said Craig Carpenito, the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey who is leading the hoarding and price-gouging task force. Since then, federal law enforcement are following other alleged scams attempting to sell millions of N95 masks that are either marked up or may not exist. One of the federal investigations came after a union representing California health care workers announced it believed it found 39 million masks from a supplier and after Kaiser Permanente health care system placed an order for 6 million masks then canceled because the deal appeared to be suspicious, CNN reported Monday. In another case, a Georgia man attempted to sell the Department of Veterans Affairs 125 million nonexistent masks and other equipment for $750 million. The man was charged with wire fraud. At the local level, state attorneys general have opened cases to fight other types of possible scams. For instance, Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt sued televangelist Jim Bakker and his production company for promoting on his show a “Silver Solution” as an anti-coronavirus immunity boost. “There is, in fact, no vaccine, pill, potion or other product available to treat or cure coronavirus disease 2019,” the Missouri lawsuit said. In Michigan, the state noticed the stimulus scam has already started, with phishing emails asking recipients for their bank information to receive the $1,200 check from the government. Nessel had heard of the scam first through a contact at another state agency, who sent it directly to her.  Since then, she’s had friends, family, even acquaintances from high school forwarding her scam emails and texts – and she’s responding to them with what to look for.  “Next time my mother sends me a text message, I’m going to reply, ‘New number, who dis?’ ” she joked. “But my point is that we rely on others to assist” spreading the word that scams are out there, Nessel said. “This is the enemy of our time. We all have to work together.”",

    "content": "In the end it was the thriving online scam centers that finally forced China to lose patience with Myanmar’s brutal military rulers. The impoverished Southeast Asian nation has long been a trouble spot on China’s southwestern border. For decades Beijing’s leaders have played a careful game of backing Myanmar’s military regimes – lending them much-needed economic, military and diplomatic support, including at the United Nations – whilst also maintaining close ties to powerful rebel militias along its borders. But Beijing’s frustration has been building with Naypyidaw’s generals who seized power in 2021, overthrowing a democratically elected government that Beijing had built close relations with, and resurrecting the kind of isolated junta rule that Myanmar’s people had spent decades living under. The deeply unpopular regime has since been busy fighting a vicious civil war, struggling to govern growing swathes of its territory or deliver on Beijing’s economic and strategic interests there, including an ambitious infrastructure corridor aimed at connecting China’s landlocked southwest with the Indian Ocean. In recent months, that displeasure has reached new heights as the junta dragged its feet on a pressing security priority for Beijing: shutting down the infamous online scam centers that have proliferated along its border with Myanmar. The country’s mountainous borderlands have long been a haven for gambling, drugs and the trafficking of both humans and wildlife. But since the Covid-19 pandemic, online scam operations – many run by Chinese organized crime bosses – have flourished. In heavily guarded compounds controlled by local warlords, tens of thousands of people, mainly Chinese, have been trapped and forced by criminal gangs to defraud strangers with sophisticated schemes over the internet. Beijing has pressed Myanmar’s military government to rein in the scam operations with little success. Things started to change in late October, when an alliance of ethnic rebel groups launched a major offensive – dubbed Operation 1027 – against the junta. As the ethnic militias captured towns and military posts in the northern Shan state, numerous scam compounds near the Chinese border were liberated. Thousands of trafficked victims have been sent back to China, along with suspected ringleaders, according to Chinese authorities and the triumphant militias. Powerful warlord families, backed by the junta and once deemed untouchable by the law, are now in the custody of Chinese police. “China has been leveraging Operation 1027 in order to maximize pressure on the military regime to compel it to begin a crackdown on cross-border crime that targets Chinese nationals,” said Jason Tower, Myanmar country director of the United States Institute of Peace (USIP). Last week, Beijing said it helped the junta broker a temporary ceasefire with the rebels, after arranging for the two sides to meet in China for peace talks. But Beijing’s assistance has carried a heavy price tag – the downfall of the remaining crime families the junta had relied on to rule the border region. ‘Tacit support’ China’s growing frustration with the junta over its failure to tackle the scam industry was not lost on the ethnic rebels as they planned their attack for October 27. In announcing the offensive, the armed ethnic groups – collectively called the Three Brotherhood Alliance – cited the need to take out the massive scam operations as a major justification. The alliance pledged to not only overthrow the military dictatorship, but also “eradicate telecom fraud, scam dens and their patrons nationwide, including in areas along the China-Myanmar border” – a message experts say was clearly intended for Beijing. China began publicly pushing the junta to crack down on cross-border crime targeting Chinese nationals in May, when then Foreign Minister Qin Gang visited Myanmar’s capital Naypyidaw and raised the issue with army chief Gen. Min Aung Hlaing. “For that to fall on deaf ears for several months, and for the criminal activity to continue, I think it ultimately played a role in China giving some tacit support to Operation 1027,” said Tower, the expert at USIP. For much of this year, Chinese officials have urged the ethnic armed groups to restrain from escalating the conflict and to sit down for negotiations with the military – which led to a few meetings between the two sides, according to Tower. “This seems to have changed pretty dramatically after October. China’s frustration (with the junta) is ultimately what led to it lifting that pressure. And once that pressure was lifted, something like Operation 1027 became possible,” he said. One key hub for the scam syndicates was Kokang, a region home to many ethnic Han Chinese and controlled by the Myanmar military through the Kokang Border Guard Force. The militia was established by junta chief Min Aung Hlaing to rule Kokang after he led a military operation in 2009 to oust the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA). The MNDAA, a predominantly ethnic Chinese armed group, is now a key player in the Three Brotherhood Alliance taking back territory in the region. ‘Last straw’ Experts say a particularly brutal incident in Kokang’s capital Laukkaing, a glistening casino city bordering China’s Yunnan province that has descended in recent years into a lawless hub for internet fraud, was another major test of Beijing’s patience. According to local media reports in Myanmar and Thailand, in the small hours of October 20, multiple Chinese citizens were shot and killed by guards during an attempted escape from a scam center in Laukkaing. Those reports soon began circulating on Chinese social media. Four undercover Chinese police officers were rumored to be among the victims – a claim that was shared online by Hu Xijin, former editor-in-chief of state-run tabloid Global Times. According to Chinese state media, the compound, Crouching Tiger Villa, was run by Ming Xuechang, a former Kokang official and head of a powerful family whose members hold prominent positions in the local government and junta militia. “I think that was kind of the last straw that led to China more or less greenlighting this operation,” Tower said. Four days after the launch of Operation 1027, China’s Minister of Public Security Wang Xiaohong arrived in Naypyidaw. In a meeting with Min Aung Hlaing, the Chinese police chief said law enforcement agencies in both countries would strengthen cooperation to crack down on cyber scams and online gambling. Then in mid-November, Chinese police issued arrest warrants for Ming and his three relatives, including his son, who is a leader in the Kokang Border Guard Force. They were accused of running scam hubs that target Chinese citizens and openly using armed forces to protect their operations. Days later, the three relatives were handed over the border and taken into Chinese custody, while Ming reportedly took his own life before he could be arrested, according to China’s state broadcaster CCTV. As of late November, authorities in Myanmar had handed over 31,000 suspects to China since authorities from both countries launched a crackdown on online scams in September, according to China’s Ministry of Public Security. The vast majority of those suspects were handed back after Operation 1027. Richard Horsey, senior adviser on Myanmar for the International Crisis Group, said the crackdown on scam centers had in the short term assumed a higher priority than peace on the border for China. “China has calculated that it is worth a short-term period of instability and conflict on the border in order to shut down the scam centers,” he said. “But I don’t think China wants this conflict to continue longer than necessary…(or) to spread wider than necessary.” Peace talks In public, China has repeatedly called for de-escalation of the conflict in Myanmar. Announcing the temporary ceasefire on Thursday, a spokesperson for China’s Foreign Ministry said Beijing had been making “relentless efforts to promote talks to end the fighting” since it broke out in October. But experts say in practice, Beijing had taken a largely hands-off approach until earlier this month. China’s sudden involvement in peace talks may reflect Beijing’s calculation shifting again, experts say. The rebel offensive in Shan was hugely successful – and other insurgent groups launched their own attacks elsewhere across Myanmar, spreading the junta’s already stretched forces even thinner. “Chinese authorities likely did not expect that the operation would result in the complete disruption of the lucrative China-Myanmar border trade, nor did they expect that it would ripple across the entire country, causing the Myanmar military to lose hundreds of posts and suffer unprecedented battlefield losses,” said Tower. Beijing is increasingly concerned that the prolonged disruption to border trade would deal a serious blow to the already struggling economy in southwest China, especially the border province of Yunnan; the ongoing conflict could also undermine China’s energy security, as many of its southwestern provinces rely on the China-Myanmar pipeline for access to oil and gas, according to Tower. Those concerns have likely played a role in China’s decision to help the junta broker the peace talks with the Three Brotherhood Alliance. But Beijing’s help came at a heavy price. On December 10, the day before the military government revealed it held talks with the rebels with the help of China, the Chinese police issued a fresh batch of arrest warrants for 10 alleged “ringleaders” of Kokang’s online scams syndicates accused of fraud, murder and trafficking. The 10 hail from powerful families in Kokang, including leaders in the Border Guard Force that controls what remains of one of the junta’s most important border zones with China. The most prominent figure among them is Bai Suocheng, who defected from the MNDAA and partnered with Min Aung Hlaing to establish Myanmar army control over the region back in 2009. Experts say China is effectively using the warrants to force the junta to quietly exit Kokang and hand the territory back to the MNDAA. “These warrants put the Myanmar army in an extremely difficult position. As the Myanmar army cannot control Kokang without its Border Guard Force leaders, handing them over to the Chinese side amounts to surrendering Kokang over to the MNDAA and its allies,” Tower said. Horsey at the International Crisis Group said the ceasefire could be the final act in MNDAA’s dramatic takeover of Kokang. “The Myanmar military is now constrained from launching any counterattack, but able to safely withdraw its forces,” he said. “But there are many moving parts and whether this will result in a bloodless MNDAA takeover of Laukkaing remains to be seen.” Meanwhile the ceasefire already looks shaky. On Wednesday, the Three Brotherhood Alliance reaffirmed its commitment to defeat the military dictatorship. It made no mention of peace talks or a ceasefire. And fighting has continued in Shan state. The Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), an ethnic rebel group under the Three Brotherhood Alliance, told AFP news agency it captured the trading hub of Namhsan on Friday, a day after Beijing announced the temporary ceasefire.",

    "content": "If you’re tired of getting random calls from companies claiming to be from “dealer services” and offering you an extended warranty on your car, the Federal Trade Commission is taking aim at some companies accused of making those calls. The FTC has filed suit against American Vehicle Protection Corp. of Florida and several affiliated people and companies for allegedly deceptive telemarketing practices. Operators working for the companies allegedly called people and told them they were working with automakers such as Toyota and Ford that produced the cars people  owned, according to the complaint. In fact, the complaint alleges, they were not. “AVP blasted consumers with illegal calls and made bogus claims about bumper-to-bumper warranties,” Samuel Levine, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement. “The truth is that the warranties didn’t come from the manufacturer, didn’t cover the repairs people needed, and weren’t sold legally.” Operators pitched “bumper-to-bumper” or “full coverage” auto warranties that were allegedly riddled with exceptions for various parts, according to the FTC. Sales people even told consumers that specific parts were covered that were specifically excluded, according to the FTC. The warranties were sold with the promise the policies could be canceled and money refunded within 30 days, the FTC said. When customers tried to cancel the policies, calls to the company often went unanswered and money was not returned until pressure was applied by regulatory agencies or the Better Business Bureau, according to the complaint. Prices for the policies ranged from $2,800 to $3,400. The alleged scams have taken over $6 million from consumers since 2018, according to the complaint. The companies also repeatedly called people who were on the National Do Not Call Registry even after they had been informed the numbers were on the list, the FTC said in its complaint. The companies also did not pay fees required to access the list before making calls, according to the agency. In its lawsuit, the FTC is seeking financial redress for consumers and a permanent injunction to prevent the companies from doing any of these alleged deeds again. Mitchell Roth, an attorney for American Vehicle Protection and other defendants in the case said AVP shut down operations after learning of the FTC’s complaints. The firm implemented extensive changes to its sales practices to ensure compliance with laws, Roth said. Roth’s clients have also filed their own suit against the FTC claiming that, under a recent Supreme Court decision, the FTC has no power to seek financial relief from his clients. “AVP is committed to complying with all laws and finds it unfortunate that the Commission chose to pursue its lawsuit notwithstanding the changes that it implemented and notwithstanding the limits imposed on its powers by Congress as described in AVP’s lawsuit,” he said.",

They do it for various reasons, including to target potential love interests or people they’re trying to befriend.  Other catfishers can be child predators trying to gain the trust of a minor. In the Southern California case, Austin Lee Edwards, 28, portrayed himself as a teenager to lure the girl, authorities say. While investigators did not provide details on what platforms the suspect used or how long he knew her, catfishers can be found on most social media platforms.  “Catfishing certainly has psychological attributes to it, including the ability to pretend to be someone else and to exert power over a vulnerable person,” says Aaron Brantly, an associate professor at Virginia Tech and and director of the university’s Tech4Humanity lab.  There are red flags that parents should look out for Social media sites and apps – along with catfishing scams – have taken off in recent years. Experts say there are potential signals that people should be on the lookout for.  “Parents should pay attention to children who become intensely attached to individuals in both physical and virtual spaces,” Brantly says. “Often, individuals engaged in catfishing will seek to encourage their targets to hide their online relationships from friends and family.”  Fareedah Shaheed, an internet safety expert whose  focus is protecting kids online, says another warning sign is people who don’t want to appear on a video call or cancel plans to meet in person. The FBI urges people to think twice when someone appears “too perfect,” as it may be part of a romance scam. Sometimes, it means that person has studied their intended victim’s digital footprint to understand them more deeply. That’s another reason why people should be cautious of what they share online about themselves or their children. “Scammers can use details shared on social media and dating sites to better understand and target you,” the FBI says, warning against the type of person who “quickly asks you to leave a social media site to communicate directly” or attempts to isolate people from friends and family. Parents can take measures to combat catfishing before it starts With social media playing such a crucial role in our lives today, safety experts say that parents should have honest and nonjudgmental conversations with kids about digital safety, while even getting involved in their online worlds. This can be a lifeline that connects them to their children’s pervasive virtual reality.  “For example, game with them, send each other funny or interesting short videos from social media, listen to their gaming or social media stories, get curious about their online activities and ask them questions about it,” Shaheed says.  “Be a good digital role model. If you want them to post with privacy in mind on social media, be sure that you’re doing the same. It’s much easier to have internet privacy conversations when they see you doing what you speak on.”  Openly talking about digital safety allows parents to keep tabs on who kids are talking to online. It also helps parents know the specific apps their children are on and identify any anomalies in online behavior.   “Discussing who children are interacting with in online environments and developing a pattern of trust and an atmosphere of openness and transparency is an important step in minimizing the potential adverse interactions in online spaces,” Brantly says.  Parents should also set clear times for device use, and establish patterns and boundaries on when and how devices should be used. “If in doubt, start a conversation that starts from a position of mutual trust,” he adds.  For added security, parents can keep tabs on their kids’ online activities through safety apps. Shaheed points to Norton Family, Microsoft Family Safety, Google Family Link and Apple Family Sharing as reliable examples.  “The internet can be a dangerous place if internet security and privacy aren’t taken seriously,” she says.  “If your kids are online, please take time to understand how to keep them safe. You don’t have to do this alone. Start searching for communities, tools, people and resources that can help you get started with protecting your children online.” Privacy conversations are best held in the car or while walking – in a comfortable setting that does not appear intimidating.  “Be sure that your internet privacy conversations are consistent and not just one long conversation before you give them access to social media,”  Shaheed says. “Make your internet privacy conversation an actual conversation and not a lecture. Ask them questions and ask them what they think they should do for their own privacy online then give them some extra suggestions and the reason why for each suggestion.” Internet users can also take additional precautions  Digital safety experts have other suggestions for how internet users can combat catfishing. They include:  The most important tip experts have to offer is: Trust your gut instinct. ",

    "content": "Ryan Last received a message on a school night in February from someone he believed to be a girl.  Within hours, the 17-year-old, straight-A student and Boy Scout had died by suicide.  “Somebody reached out to him pretending to be a girl, and they started a conversation,” his mother, Pauline Stuart, told CNN, fighting back tears as she described what happened to her son days after she and Ryan had finished visiting several colleges he was considering attending after graduating high school.   The online conversation quickly grew intimate, and then turned criminal.  The scammer – posing as a young girl – sent Ryan a nude photo and then asked Ryan to share an explicit image of himself in return. Immediately after Ryan shared an intimate photo of his own, the cybercriminal demanded $5,000, threatening to make the photo public and send it to Ryan’s family and friends.    The San Jose, California, teen told the cybercriminal he could not pay the full amount, and the demand was ultimately lowered to a fraction of the original figure – $150. But after paying the scammers from his college savings, Stuart said, “They kept demanding more and more and putting lots of continued pressure on him.”  At the time, Stuart knew none of what her son was experiencing. She learned the details after law enforcement investigators reconstructed the events leading up to his death.  She had said goodnight to Ryan at 10 p.m., and described him as her usually happy son. By 2 a.m., he had been scammed, and taken his life. Ryan left behind a suicide note describing how embarrassed he was for himself and the family.   “He really, truly thought in that time that there wasn’t a way to get by if those pictures were actually posted online,” Pauline said. “His note showed he was absolutely terrified. No child should have to be that scared.”  Law enforcement calls the scam “sextortion,” and investigators have seen an explosion in complaints from victims leading the FBI to ramp up a campaign to warn parents from coast to coast.   The bureau says there were over 18,000 sextortion-related complaints in 2021, with losses in excess of $13 million. The FBI says the use of child pornography by criminals to lure suspects also constitutes a serious crime.  The investigation into Last’s case is ongoing, Stuart and the FBI tell CNN. “To be a criminal that specifically targets children – it’s one of the more deeper violations of trust I think in society,” says FBI Supervisory Special Agent Dan Costin, who leads a team of investigators working to counter crimes against children.   According to Costin, many of the sextortion scams reported to the FBI are determined to be from criminals on the African continent and in Southeast Asia. Federal investigators are working with their law enforcement counterparts around the world, Costin said, to help identify and arrest perpetrators who are targeting kids online.    One challenge for the FBI: many victims of sextortion do not report the incidents to law enforcement.   “The embarrassment piece of this is probably one of the bigger hurdles that the victims have to overcome,” said Costin. “It can be a lot, especially in that moment.”  But investigators urge victims to quickly contact law enforcement, either online or at their local FBI field office.   Medical experts say there’s a key reason why young males are especially vulnerable to sextortion-related scams.   “Teen brains are still developing,” said Dr. Scott Hadland, chief of adolescent medicine at Mass General in Boston. “So when something catastrophic happens, like a personal picture is released to people online, it’s hard for them to look past that moment and understand that in the big scheme of things they’ll be able to get through this.”  Hadland said there are steps parents can take to help safeguard their kids from online harm.   “The most important thing that a parent should do with their teen is try to understand what they’re doing online,” she said. “You want to know when they’re going online, who they’re interacting with, what platforms they’re using. Are they being approached by people that they don’t know, are they experiencing pressure to share information or photos?”  Hadland said it’s also critical that parents specifically warn teens of scams like sextortion, without shaming them.   “You want to make it clear that they can talk to you if they have done something, or they feel like they’ve made a mistake,” he said.   Ryan’s mom agrees.   “You need to talk to your kids because we need to make them aware of it,” Stuart said.   Still grieving the loss of her son, she is channeling her family’s pain into action, and honoring Ryan by speaking out and telling his story. She hopes that doing so will help save lives.   “How could these people look at themselves in the mirror knowing that $150 is more important than a child’s life?” she says. “There’s no other word but ‘evil’ for me that they care much more about money than a child’s life. I don’t want anybody else to go through what we did.” ",

    "content": " After years of focusing on home mortgage scams, the Federal Trade Commission is turning its sights on what it calls bogus auto loan modifications. The FTC says fraud artists are moving from mortgage loan modification schemes and  targeting consumers who are underwater on their auto loans.        In a motion filed in a U.S. District Court in California, the FTC asked the court to stop two California companies, “Auto Debt Consulting” and “Hope for Car Owners,” from allegedly deceiving consumers. The government alleges both companies have racked up hundreds of dollars in up-front fees for loan modifications that were never performed for customers. Additionally, the FTC hopes to force the companies to cease what it says are deceptive marketing tactics.        Authorities allege the companies told customers to stop making payments on their vehicles, and in some cases told victims to “hide [their] car[s] to avoid repossession.”       “Hope for Car Owners” made claims it could reduce monthly auto loan payments by up to 50% in return for fees ranging between $200 and $500, the FTC alleges.         Similarly, “Auto Debt Consulting” is accused of promoting that it could reduce monthly auto loan payments between 25% and 40%  in exchange for $350 to $799 in fees.       Gregory Ashe, senior staff attorney for the Bureau of Consumer Protection at the FTC, said the agency is increasing its focus on the auto loan industry because, “We want the misrepresentation to stop.” He added, “With these actions we want to stop the problem before it gets too big … we’re not going to tolerate deception.”        But according to “Help for Car Owners” founder Patrick Freeman, the FTC’s claims are “completely baseless.” Freeman said he stopped using his company’s website for marketing purposes in January 2011 and began the process of dissolving his company earlier this year. Since then, Freeman said he has been assisting customers who are in immediate danger of having their cars repossessed.         In 2008, as the U.S. economy plummeted, many people found their mortgages and auto loans in danger of default. Freeman said he started “Help for Car Owners” in an attempt to help customers keep their automobiles, and his success proved overwhelming, he said.  In 2009, during the first months of business for “Help for Car Owners,” he said he received more than 20,000 calls for help with delinquent auto loans. Freeman said, “In many cases people called me crying … with the repo man at their door.”       In January, Freeman said lenders were no longer willing to work with him. He began the processes of shuttering his business. Freeman said he shredded many of the documents he had supporting his claims. “We didn’t destroy the documents, we got rid of them, it was a huge amount of files,” Freeman said. He said the burden of being financially insolvent and having no place to store his company’s files led him to destroy them. It’s a claim he also made in court on Wednesday.         In the end, Freeman said he puts blame on clients who he said misled the FTC about their relationship with his company and didn’t disclose contracts they had signed with “Help for Car Owners.” Speaking about his customers, Freeman noted, “90% of my clients never saved a dime … they manipulated the system for their gain.” He also blames predatory collection tactics by lending companies who finance auto loans far exceeding borrowers’ income.        Freeman told the judge on Wednesday that he intends to represent himself against the charges. The next hearing is scheduled for April 16. Freeman said he is broke and doesn’t have money for an attorney, but he’s not fearful of taking on the government by himself, saying he only wants to clear his name. As to the allegations levied against him, he said, “Ultimately, the FTC claims we made guarantees of loan modifications. We didn’t, we made guarantees we would make every effort to facilitate the opportunity for assistance [with their car loans].”      A check of the Better Business Bureau’s records showed that “Hope for Car Owners” gets a grade of “F,” the BBB’s lowest. “Auto Debt Consulting” received a “D-” with more than a dozen complaints on file.        Both companies are accused of violating the FTC act intended to protect cash-strapped consumers. So-called “last dollar scams” often involve bogus offers of easy moneymaking schemes that dupe uneducated and desperate customers. CNN made multiple attempts to reach “Auto Debt Consulting” for this story but received no response.",

    "content": "The former CEO of one of the world’s largest investment management companies was sentenced Friday to nine months in prison for using fraud and bribes to try to get five of his children into exclusive colleges as fake athletic recruits, the US District Attorney’s Office in Massachusetts said. Douglas Hodge, who led the Pacific Investment Management Company, agreed to use Rick Singer’s college admissions “side-door” scam for five of his children, paying bribes totaling $850,000 over the course of a decade, according to prosecutors.  Prosecutors had asked that he be sentenced to 24 months in prison. The nine-month sentence is the longest of any parent charged in the case, surpassing the six-month sentence given in November to Toby MacFarlane, who also pleaded guilty. By comparison, actress Felicity Huffman was sentenced to just two weeks in prison for her admitted role in the scam. Two of Hodge’s children were accepted to Georgetown University as false tennis recruits, two children were accepted to the University of Southern California as a false soccer recruit and a false football recruit, and Hodge attempted to use bribes to get a fifth child into Loyola Marymount University, according to prosecutors. Hodge also lied to the IRS by deducting these bribe payments from his income taxes as purported charitable donations, prosecutors said in a sentencing memo. Hodge initially fought the charges in the case, but in October he agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy. His attorneys asked for a sentence at the low end of the sentencing guidelines range, comparable to other parents who received sentences measured in weeks. “Doug participated in Rick Singer’s process not out of ego or a desire for self-aggrandizement, but rather out of love for his children and an overriding, but misguided desire to be helpful to them,” his attorneys wrote in their sentencing memo. Hodge spent 28 years at Pimco, one of the largest money managers in the world, and served at least two as CEO. He left in 2017. Singer, the mastermind of the sprawling scam, has pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy and other charges. ‘Obviously we have stretched the truth’ According to the criminal complaint released last year, Singer forwarded to Hodge two falsified athletic profiles for one of Hodge’s sons. One of the profiles portrayed him as a star football player and the other portrayed him as a star tennis player. “Obviously we have stretched the truth but this is what is done for all kids. Admissions just needs something to work with to show he is an athlete,” Singer wrote in an email, according to the complaint. His son was accepted to USC as a football recruit, but he did not actually join the team, the complaint says. In exchange, Hodge paid USC athletics official Donna Heinel a $75,000 check payable to the USC “Womens Athletic Board,” $125,000 to Singer’s business The Key and $125,000 to Singer’s fake charity Key Worldwide Foundation. In a November 30 recorded phone call made at the direction of investigators, Singer and Hodge agreed to lie to the IRS to cover up their crimes, prosecutors said. “So you don’t have to worry. I’m not going to– I’m not– I’m not going off script here,” Hodge said in the call, federal records show.",

    "content": "A New York woman who falsely claimed to be a grieving family member of a Sandy Hook shooting victim and set up a fake charity to defraud donors has been sentenced to eight months in prison, according to a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s office.   Nouel Alba, 37, will also serve two years of supervised release but will not have to pay a fine, said Thomas Carson of the U.S. Attorney’s office.  Alba plead guilty in June to wire fraud and lying to FBI agents, federal prosecutors in Connecticut said.   Alba, prosecutors said, set up false bank accounts and claimed she was collecting for a “funeral fund” set up on behalf of Noah Pozner, one of the 20 children killed in the December attacks. The woman allegedly claimed to be an aunt of the Sandy Hook Elementary School student. Donations were solicited on a Facebook page that Alba had created and to which she had posted photos of Noah. Donors sent $240 to a PayPal account between December 14 and 20, federal prosecutors in New York said earlier this year. Alba’s public defender, Deirdre Murray, did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.   CNN was alerted to the story by a relative of the Pozner family. A CNN producer and camera crew went to Alba’s home in the Bronx, New York. She said that the bank account referenced on her Facebook page did in fact belong to her. Alba denied being involved in a scam during an appearance on CNN’s “Anderson Cooper 360” in December. The U.S. Attorney’s office said FBI agents contacted Alba after seeing the CNN report and that she told the agents the same thing she told CNN. Alba falsely told agents that she did not post information related to Newtown on her Facebook account or have contact with anyone about such postings or access her PayPal account, prosecutors said in a statement. “The thought that someone would scheme so quickly and deliberately to benefit from an unspeakable tragedy is beyond belief,” Kimberly Mertz, FBI special agent in charge, said in a statement. “While there wasn’t a substantial loss of money in this investigation, there were losses beyond any pecuniary measure.” The indictment against Alba in December cited CNN’s reporting. Noah, 6, and 19 other children and six adults were shot to death at the Newtown school on December 14. The gunman, Adam Lanza, 20, killed himself after the rampage.

    "content": "Scammers are using robocalls that spread disinformation about the coronavirus pandemic and lying about offering low-priced health insurance and free coronavirus test kits.   CNN’s KFile listened to and reviewed data of coronavirus robocalls provided by the protection app NoMoRobo and found more than 60 different phone numbers falsely claiming to have free coronavirus test kits or advertising health insurance. Another kind of robocall, sponsored by the Support American Leaders PAC, uses a recording of President Donald Trump and asks callers to sign a petition to ban flights from China. The group is not affiliated with Trump and, unlike most other super PACs, doesn’t raise money for advertisements to support Trump, either. It mostly raises funds to pay for more robocalls, which are used to raise more funds, with the owner of the group pocketing the difference. The PAC did not respond to CNN requests for comment.   The coronavirus robocalls are dangerous for a myriad of reasons, said Aaron Foss, the founder of NoMoRobo. “With all of the confusion around the mobilization efforts, you really don’t know what to believe,” Foss said over email. “With everyone on social isolation, many, many more people are at home, especially seniors,” making them more available to accept the calls and likely to give their credit card information or a donation if asked, he explained.  While there are automated calls from scammers, legitimate automated messages from federal, state and local officials continue to inform the public on the coronavirus pandemic by offering informational resources, like a referral number to the coronavirus hotline or a government website. If a robocall offers free or discounted services, contacts you without your previous consent, or tells you to press “1” or some other key to be taken off a call list, it is likely a scam call.  Consumers are advised by federal agencies not to pick up the phone if it is an unknown number and not to engage with the robocall if they do. They can also block the call using software or a service from their phone provider, and report an unwanted or illegal call to the Federal Trade Commission. Several federal agencies oversee the fight against robocalls, including the FTC and the Federal Communications Commission.  A spokesperson for the FCC, Will Wiquist, told CNN over email they were aware of such calls and were looking into them. “As a general matter we wouldn’t weigh in on if a certain example might be a violation and we cannot comment on if we would formally investigate,” he told CNN. “That said, we are aware of some such communications and are looking into it.” How the coronavirus robocalls work A robocall is defined by the FTC as illegal if it is trying to sell you something unless a company has your written permission to call you that way. Purely informational calls, such as reminding you of an appointment, school delays, flight updates, are legal, as are calls from health care providers reminding you to pick up your prescription. Automated political calls, debt collection calls and messages from charities are also exempt.  But the calls falsely advertising free coronavirus test kits are illegal. According to Foss, the scam works like this: Criminal robocallers blast out millions of automated calls using “gateway carriers,” which accept foreign call traffic and direct it to US consumers. Once a person accepts the phone call, they hear a pre-recorded message regarding the coronavirus that can go like this: “The coronavirus has caused the US to declare a national emergency. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act has made coronavirus testing more accessible immediately. If you want to receive a free testing kit delivered overnight to your home, press one.”  The message is riddled with inaccuracies. While the US has declared a national emergency, The Families First Coronavirus Response Act was not signed into law when the robocall first sprung up on March 16. While coronavirus testing is ramping up in the US, there is no legitimate way to get a home-delivered kit. Testing is still limited through lab facilities ordered by medical professionals. If a person presses “1,” they are transferred to a call center, which can either be in the US or overseas, where an operator impersonates the federal government and tries to scam the caller into handing over their credit card information, usually for the “shipping and handling” of the “free” coronavirus test kit, Foss said. “It’s a field day for the robocallers,” Foss told CNN over email. “Best case, the scammers steal their money and are never heard from again. Worst case, the scammers ship a non-working ‘test kit’ that could make the pandemic even worse.” “If that fake test kit says you don’t have the virus, you’re more likely to go out and get infected or infect others,” Foss added. And if a person does fall for one of these scams, it’s just the beginning. Foss says that your number is then put on a “high value target” list that leaves you vulnerable to more robocall scams in the future.  One robocall called CNN’s KFile trying to sell health insurance plans. A CNN reporter pressed “1: to speak with a representative.” A woman answered, “Hi, this is Christina. Do you have insurance and don’t like it or need insurance?”  The conversation quickly turned hostile before CNN could identify itself as journalists. When asked who was sponsoring the call, the representative responded, “Who’s sponsoring what? If you were transferred to me you had to push a button to get to me. We were reaching out to make sure you have health insurance. Have you been watching the news?”  “I have been watching the news, yeah,” a CNN reporter said. “OK, we were just reaching out to make sure you have health insurance because things are pretty scary right now. So do you need help with health insurance? Because I’m an independent broker. I don’t work for an insurance agency, I actually work for my client. If you need help, I can definitely get you some insurance,” she said.  “Who’s your client? Like, if you’re an independent broker?” “I’m reaching out to people. If you’re not my client, then we shouldn’t be talking anymore,” she said.  After trying to clarify who she worked for, the representative snapped. “Do you need help? You pressed the button because you said you needed insurance. There was a button that said if you want to be put on the do not call list, you could have pressed that one but you chose to press the one to reach me and now you’re asking me 20 questions. All you had to do was push 2 and you would have been put on the do not call list. But I’ll take care of it for you on this end.” Then she hung up.   Not the World Health Organization Another call seemingly impersonates the World Health Organization, claiming to be the “Worldwide Health Organization” and offers protective equipment from the EPA.  “Greetings this is an automated message alert from the Worldwide Health Organization to inform you about the EPA.’s Emerging Viral Pathogen Program for the coronavirus protection,” the call says. “We offer you the opportunity to obtain the most powerful and secure protection equipment to protect yourself and all your family members.” A callback number from the robocall is no longer in service. The EPA does not review those types of devices. In an email to CNN, a spokesperson for the EPA wrote, “The emerging viral pathogens claim is a real thing, but it only applies to EPA-registered disinfectants has reviewed data on, not devices or machines.”  Super PAC robocalls play on people’s fears and politics Some robocalls are taking advantage of public anxiety by playing to people’s politics. Support American Leaders PAC, a super PAC that CNN previously reported on for impersonating the Trump campaign, begins its robocalls with a recording of Donald Trump. “I’m Donald Trump, we have to fix this because it just doesn’t work,” the recording says, followed by a male voice saying: “President Trump needs your emergency support to pressure Congress to suspend all flights from China to the US, so we can stem the coronavirus outbreak. If I have your permission to sign your name to suspend all flights from China to the US and support President Trump, press ‘1’.” If the listener presses “1” on their phones, they get taken to a phone operator who then asks for a donation. The call was detected on March 12; Trump suspended virtually all flights to and from China in January, making the PAC’s assertion that he needs support to pressure Congress  false. Also, unlike most other super PACs that raise money to support candidates by running ads or supporting efforts to increase voter turnout, Support American Leaders PAC effectively raises most of its money for robocalls, which are then made to solicit more money, and so on. Matthew Tunstall, the man who runs Support American Leaders PAC, takes home whatever money remains. As CNN previously reported, Tunstall has a history of running these type of shadowy groups that target people with politically charged messages before asking them for a donation under the guise that the person’s donation is actually going towards helping a candidate. Neither Tunstall, nor Maureen Otis, the PAC’s listed treasurer, returned a CNN request for comment. The Trump campaign condemned the PAC robocall in an email to CNN’s KFile.  “Scammers will use every trick in the book to try to convince people that something is sanctioned communication from the President or his campaign. This call is not authentic and we do not condone it,” wrote spokesman Ken Farnaso. Despite this, there’s little the Federal Elections Commission can do, according to Christian Hilland, the FEC’s Deputy Press Officer.  “The agency is currently operating without a working quorum, and as a result, the Commission is unable to move forward on enforcement matters at this time,” he said.",

    "content": "Artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT could lead to a “turbocharging” of consumer harms including fraud and scams, and the US government has substantial authority to crack down on AI-driven consumer harms under existing law, members of the Federal Trade Commission said Tuesday.  Addressing House lawmakers, FTC chair Lina Khan said the “turbocharging of fraud and scams that could be enabled by these tools are a serious concern.” In recent months, a new crop of AI tools have gained attention for their ability to generate convincing emails, stories and essays as well as images, audio and videos. While these tools have potential to change the way people work and create, some have also raised concerns about how they could be use to deceive by impersonating individuals. Even as policymakers across the federal government debate how to promote specific AI rules, citing concerns about possible algorithmic discrimination and privacy issues, companies could still face FTC investigations today under a range of statutes that have been on the books for years, Khan and her fellow commissioners said.  “Throughout the FTC’s history we have had to adapt our enforcement to changing technology,” said FTC Commissioners Rebecca Slaughter. “Our obligation is to do what we’ve always done, which is to apply the tools we have to these changing technologies … [and] not be scared off by this idea that this is a new, revolutionary technology.” FTC Commissioner Alvaro Bedoya said companies cannot escape liability simply by claiming that their algorithms are a black box. “Our staff has been consistently saying our unfair and deceptive practices authority applies, our civil rights laws, fair credit, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, those apply,” said Bedoya. “There is law, and companies will need to abide by it.” The FTC has previously issued extensive public guidance to AI companies, and the agency last month received a request to investigate OpenAI over claims that the company behind ChatGPT has misled consumers about the tool’s capabilities and limitations.

    "content": "A couple dubbed the “Italian Bonnie and Clyde” who impersonated the US actor George Clooney to sell their clothing line have been arrested in Thailand.  Francesco Galdelli, 58, and his wife Vanya Goffi, 45, who have been on the run for six years, were arrested Saturday in the Thai city of Pattaya in a joint operation by Royal Thai Police and Italian agents from Interpol, Italian police said in a statement.  In 2010, Clooney took the witness stand in Italy and accused the couple of fraudulently using his name and forged signatures to create a bogus fashion line.  Galdelli and Goffi also orchestrated a series of scams and frauds including selling fake Rolex watches online and sending their victims packets of salt instead of watches, Italian police said.   The pair were convicted and sentenced in 2014 – Galdelli to 8 years and 4 months, Goffi to 6 years and 5 months – by Italy’s supreme court. But by then they had fled the country and were wanted on an Interpol red notice issued by Italy. “Until 2013, they would go back and forth to Thailand,” Italian police’s Andrea Vitalone told CNN. “They were considered respectable citizens and even benefactors amid the Italian community in Thailand. Galdelli even made massive donations for a charity supporting disabled children and children with HIV. Then, they went on the run.” They were finally caught on Saturday after police surrounded the luxury villa where they were holed up, police said.  Galdelli subsequently confessed to impersonating George Clooney in order to scam people, a Thai police spokesman told CNN.  He was arrested on charges of illegally entering and staying in Thailand since “there was no legitimate migration record of his current entrance and stay,” police said. Goffi, whose entry had been registered, was charged with overstaying in the country.  Galdelli was previously arrested in 2014, at the Dusit Thani Hotel in the Thai resort city of Pattaya. But he managed to escape a day later, Italian police said.  Local police found out he had bribed prison guards in charge of his transfer, paying them 20.000 Thai Baht (£500), who he personally withdrew from a cash machine while in custody, police said.  The two Italians are being detained at the detention center of the Immigration Bureau in Pattaya, awaiting extradition proceedings. Italian police called the operation “Italian Bonnie and Clyde” after the American bank robbers of the Great Depression era.",

    "content": "Hundreds of Oasis fans are looking back in anger after falling victim to a “landslide” of ticket selling scams. The fans have lost £346 ($449) on average to fraudsters ahead of the British band’s reunion tour next year, with some losing as much as £1,000 ($1,298), UK lender Lloyds Banking Group said Tuesday. Lloyds said in a press release that an analysis of fraud reports lodged by its customers in the month following Oasis’ August announcement of its comeback tour also showed that more than 90% of the scams began with adverts on social media and that the “vast majority” started on Facebook. A spokesperson for Meta (META) told CNN that Facebook’s parent company is “continually investing in protections against fraud on (its) platforms.” “We advise our community to report any scams immediately so we can take action,” the spokesperson said, noting that Meta recently launched a pilot program allowing UK banks to share information with the company, including about ticket scams. Lloyds said Oasis fans made up around 70% of all reported ticket fraud between August 27 and September 25. The bank noted that scammers usually post fake adverts on social media for either discounted prices or tickets at inflated prices for events that have already sold out, collecting fans’ money via a bank transfer for tickets that don’t exist. “The fact that so many cases start with fake listings on social media, often in violation of the platforms’ own rules, underscores the importance of these companies taking stronger action to tackle scams,” said Liz Ziegler, fraud prevention director at Lloyds. “Buying directly from reputable, authorized platforms is the only way to guarantee you’re paying for a genuine ticket. If you’re asked to pay via bank transfer, particularly by a seller you’ve found on social media, that should immediately set alarm bells ringing.” Fraudsters have pounced on Oasis fans since the band — a staple of 1990s Britpop, led by quarreling brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher — announced that it would reunite for the first time since 2009, playing multiple shows across the United Kingdom and Ireland next summer. It later also announced tour dates in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Australia. Fans scrambling for tickets have fumed about eye-watering prices and long waits online. Last month, Oasis’ tour promoters Live Nation and SJM told CNN that they were canceling around 50,000 tickets for the band’s UK concerts that were being resold on unofficial secondary sites, in an effort to prevent price gouging. Lloyds said its customers buying Oasis tickets on a major UK ticket selling site splashed out more compared with any other music concert over the past three years, parting with an average of £563 ($731) per debit card transaction during the first day of ticket sales in August. That’s higher than the average £342 ($444) spent on tickets for Taylor Swift’s UK tour last year, it noted.",

US Citizenship and Immigration Services says the agency recently received reports of an email phishing scam targeting would-be participants in Uniting for Ukraine, the Biden administration program that gives people in the United States the opportunity to sponsor Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion. The reports described “a basic email phishing scam that requested payment from prospective Uniting for Ukraine supporters before USCIS would review an application,” the agency said. In reality, the program does not charge a fee for the filing of a declaration of financial support, one of the documents would-be sponsors are required to submit. “USCIS has cautioned applicants and beneficiaries against possible scams related to this key humanitarian parole program,” the agency said. The agency has shared several social media posts recently that warn of reported scams tied to the program and link to a USCIS website offering tips for avoiding and reporting scams. “Beware of fake denial letters with typos and other signs of not being official USCIS correspondence,” the agency said in a June tweet. The agency said the tweets were part of routine efforts to better protect applicants to its programs by highlighting scams, fraud and misconduct on the USCIS website and social media platforms.  Uniting for Ukraine began accepting applications in late April. It’s billed as a fast, streamlined program and “a key step toward fulfilling President Biden’s commitment to welcome Ukrainians fleeing Russia’s invasion.” The program requires Ukrainians seeking entry to the United States to be sponsored by people based in the US. Ukrainian applicants are considered for humanitarian parole on a case-by-case basis for up to two years. If accepted, they are eligible for work authorization. As of last week, USCIS says it has received more than 92,000 requests from people agreeing to support Ukrainian citizens or their immediate family members as part of Uniting for Ukraine.   Through the program, more than 62,000 Ukrainians have been authorized to book their own travel to the US, USCIS says. And 29,000 people have successfully arrived in the US as part of the program, according to the agency. About 71,000 additional Ukrainians have been processed into the US since March 24 through other immigration channels, USCIS says. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began in late February, millions of refugees have fled the country. Scams have also been reported in connection with other Ukraine relief efforts, including via accounts on cryptocurrency exchange platforms.",

    "content": "Wa-hoo! Congrats to the Virginia Cavaliers, who won the school’s first men’s college basketball national championship just a year after they were the first No. 1 seed to lose to a No. 16 seed in the tournament.  Here’s what else you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. (You can also get “5 Things You Need to Know Today” delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Immigration Kirstjen Nielsen was just the beginning. Donald Trump is cleaning house at Homeland Security. A day after Nielsen was dropped as secretary of Homeland Security, Secret Service Director Randolph “Tex” Alles was given the boot. And word is at least two other senior leaders will soon be shown the door, too. One official described all this to CNN as “a near-systematic purge.” Many say this is the handiwork of White House senior adviser Stephen Miller, who has been nourishing the President’s inclinations to take ever more hardline stands on immigration. So, Trump is now sweeping Homeland Security of those deemed not tough enough on the issue. We’re also now getting more info on what led to Nielsen’s ouster. She rebuffed Trump’s order to shut down the border crossing at El Paso, Texas, and bring back the family separations policy for migrants. When Nielsen told the President closing the border crossing would only end legal trade and travel (and that migrants would just go between ports), Trump told her, “I don’t care.” And last week, during his visit to the border at Calexico, California, the President told border agents not to let migrants in, two sources told CNN. After Trump left the room, the agents’ bosses told them essentially to disregard it, because doing what Trump ordered would be breaking the law. CNN’s Stephen Collinson said it’s a dilemma many in the administration end up having to deal with: “They can respect the law or they can work for Donald Trump. It’s often just not possible to do both.”  2. Israel Israeli voters go to the polls today in a general election widely seen as a referendum on Benjamin Netanyahu. The longtime Prime Minister is battling accusations of corruption and faces possible bribery and breach of trust indictments that could soon be brought by the country’s attorney general. Netanyahu denies any wrongdoing and hopes his close ties with two of the most powerful men in the world – Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin – will be enough to carry him to victory.  3. Brexit Please, don’t roll your eyes and skip down to the next item. You’re probably as tired of Brexit stories as we are, but what happens today could be a big deal. Really. UK Prime Minister Theresa May meets with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron as the Brits work to get another extension for leaving the European Union. EU leaders will meet tomorrow to talk about May’s request to move the Brexit deadline past Friday. UK lawmakers last night finally OK’d a Brexit bill that would block the dreaded no-deal Brexit, in which the UK would leave the EU without a transition plan. Many predict that would unleash an economic catastrophe for Great Britain.  4. College admissions scandal Thirteen wealthy parents and a coach will plead guilty to bribery and fraud charges in the college admissions cheating scandal case. And it looks like federal prosecutors will want the defendants to serve some prison time. For example, prosecutors say they would recommend actress Felicity Huffman, who faces 20 years in prison, get a sentence on the “low end” of the sentencing range in exchange for her plea. A federal judge will have the final say on what happens to Huffman and the other defendants. Huffman was contrite and apologized in a statement, saying she’s “ashamed of the pain” she’s caused her family and friends.  5. Duke and Duchess of Sussex  It’s a real royal conundrum. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex – better known to us as Harry and Meghan – are expecting their first child any day now. It’s a really happy time. But because both Meghan and her soon-to-be baby (seventh in line to the British throne) are US citizens, they’d be liable to pay US taxes, which could open up those private royal financial accounts to the IRS, something the royals would rather avoid. Meghan could head this off by renouncing her US citizenship once she becomes a British citizen, but the child would still be liable for US taxes until the age of 18.  BREAKFAST BROWSE MIA on ‘AI’ “American Idol” without Ryan Seacrest? Oh, the horror! But it happened last night. Seacrest missed hosting the show for the first time because of illness.  The robots are coming A sure sign of the coming robot apocalypse? Robots taking over your local Walmart. The mega retailer will use more of them to mop floors and unload boxes.

    "content": "A New Jersey woman faces four years in state prison for her role in scamming more than $400,000 from GoFundMe donors, claiming to be collecting money for a homeless man in Philadelphia.   Katelyn McClure, 29, pleaded guilty to one count of theft by deception in the second degree Monday in Burlington County, New Jersey.   In the viral story from 2017 that made national headlines, New Jersey resident McClure ran out of gas and was stranded on Interstate 95 in Philadelphia. The homeless man, Johnny Bobbitt Jr., supposedly saw her and gave her his last $20 for gas.  McClure and her then-boyfriend, Mark D’Amico, posted about the “good deed” on social media, including a picture of her with Bobbitt on a highway ramp. They also started a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for the homeless man, saying they wanted to pay it forward to the good Samaritan and get him off the streets.   Bobbitt pleaded guilty at the local level to one count of conspiracy to commit theft by deception last Friday. He faces a five-year special probation period that requires him to enter the state Superior Court drug court program, in which he’ll be expected to get a job and adhere to a structured regimen of treatment and recovery services. Any infractions could bring him a five-year prison sentence, according to Joel Bewley, a spokesman for the Burlington County Prosecutor’s Office.  CNN reached out to Bobbitt’s attorney for comment, but has not heard back.   Both Bobbitt and McClure agreed to testify against D’Amico, who has yet to enter a plea in Burlington County court on charges of theft by deception and conspiracy to commit theft by deception in the second degree. His case is scheduled to be presented next month to a Burlington County grand jury for a possible indictment.   Both McClure and Bobbitt also pleaded guilty to federal charges in early March.  D’Amico is not currently facing federal charges.    McClure’s lawyer said she had tried to stop the GoFundMe page and D’Amico wouldn’t let her.  “We’ve indicated throughout it’s my view that Mr. D’Amico is the real agent provocateur in this matter.  Kate’s role from the beginning was to help Mr. Bobbitt,” said McClure’s attorney, Jim Gerrow.    “Kate has been strong. She’s devastated by this and has been, but we look to the sentencings in federal and state courts and hopefully we can find sufficient evidence to convince both judges of her role and the fact that throughout this she started out with benign motive, her hope to help Johnny Bobbitt and not to enrich herself or anyone else,” Gerrow said.  The couple transferred the funds to their bank account and bought a BMW, expensive handbags and went on trips, including to casinos in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Nevada, according to court documents.  McClure transferred $25,000 from her bank account to Bobbitt’s in December 2017, federal prosecutors said. He received a total of $75,000 in the campaign, according to Burlington County Prosecutor Scott Coffina.  GoFundMe has since made refunds to thousands of people who donated thinking they were giving to Bobbitt. Both Bobbitt and McClure must pay back the money in restitution, per their state court plea deals.   The story began to fall apart after Bobbitt sued McClure and D’Amico, accusing them of withholding the money raised on his behalf.   “In reality, McClure never ran out of gas and Bobbitt never spent his last $20 for her,” according to a US Attorney’s Office press release. “D’Amico and McClure allegedly conspired to create the false story to obtain money from donors.”  The federal cases have not been settled. McClure could face up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine after pleading guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. She will be sentenced on June 19.  Bobbitt could face up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine on the federal charge after pleading guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. He will be sentenced at a later date. ",

    "content": "The strong labor market has given us near record low unemployment, higher wages – and an unfortunate uptick in the number of reports of job seekers getting scammed. “We are definitely seeing job scams,” said Rhonda Perkins, attorney and chief of staff of the Federal Trade Commission’s division of marketing practices. In 2021, the agency received more than twice the number of job scam reports than in 2020, Perkins said. And in the first quarter of this year, there’s been more than 16,000 complaints filed.    Job scams have been around for a while and the tactics scammers use can vary. Some will try to gain access to your personal information, while others might solicit payments from you or hire you for an illegal task, such as reshipping luxury goods that were bought using stolen credit cards.   So if you’re looking for a job, here are some of the red flags experts say to look for when reviewing potential opportunities: The job post is flashy, but offers few details  In a job seekers’ market, employers are trying to stand out. But if a job posting is all about making money quickly or other big promises – proceed with caution.  “If a job ad is using too-good-to-be-true terms like: ‘quick money,’ or  ‘unlimited earnings potential,’ or ‘laptop for free’ and has very few skill requirements … and a lot of caps and images to distract you, it just doesn’t come across professionally,” said Sara Sutton, CEO and founder of FlexJobs.  If you are unsure of the legitimacy of a post, check to see if you can find the opening posted directly on the company’s website.  You have questions, but they don’t have the answers   Getting a call from a recruiter is flattering, but make sure they are who they say they are – especially if it’s for a job you didn’t apply for.  “Pay attention to the questions they are asking you,” said Sutton. “If the recruiter is offering you a job very quickly without verifying your work experience or asking for references and moving very, very quickly – those are also red flags.” If the job description was overly vague, be sure to ask for more details about the position, duty expectations and experience requirements. “They will definitely run from you when you start asking more questions,” said Sinem Buber, lead economist at ZipRecruiter. “If they start giving you inconsistent answers or not answering your questions properly, you know that’s not a real job.” Sutton added that scammers can fraudulently use a company’s name and recommended to check the recruiter’s email is legit. For instance, if the domain is “company-inc.com” versus “company.com,” she advised looking online to see what the company uses.   They ask for personal information Job applications tend to include questions like your name, address, contact information and work experience, but it shouldn’t go much deeper than that.  “If they are asking you to provide personal information upfront during the interview stages, like your Social Security number for a background check … no legitimate company asks for a background check or Social Security number during the interview stage. That happens after you are hired,” said Buber.  Before giving out any personal information, Perkins recommended doing some online research. “Look up the name of the company, the person who claims to be hiring you, plus the word ‘scam,’ ‘review,’ or ‘complaint’… and don’t trust reviews on the company’s website. Those could be fake.”  They ask for payment  The only conversation you should be having with a potential employer about money should be about compensation. If they ask you to pay any fees for things like special services, training or software or equipment, that should be a major red flag.  “Don’t pay for the promise of a job, don’t make an upfront payment to get a job – only scammers will ask you to do that,” said Perkins.  There’s also a fake check scam that can involve a bogus company sending you too large a check for you to buy something like computer equipment and then asks you to repay the excess funds via a wire transfer service, cryptocurrency or gift cards. These forms of sending money are hard for law enforcement to trace and people to get their money back, Perkins explained.  “Under the law, banks are required to make the money available quickly, so when you deposit a check and it looks like it’s cleared that doesn’t mean it’s a good check,” said Perkins. “The bank will find out later it’s a bad check.” ",

The city made the large payment on September 14 for what they believed was a legitimate bill from Moss Construction, according to the Fort Lauderdale Police Department. Fort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis told CNN affiliate WSVN Moss Construction is working on building a police station for the city, located 28 miles north of Miami. “It’s $144 million, so they’re in full construction mode, so it would’ve been consistent with the practice that we’ve been following,” Trantalis said, WSVN reported. “It wasn’t just an email, like, ‘Hey, this is Moss Construction. Send me $1.2 million,’ It was followed up with full documentation, multiple paperwork,” Trantalis added. Fort Lauderdale police said it was later discovered the payment request was fraudulent. “Malicious actors took advantage of our good name and reputation to attempt fraud,” a Moss Construction spokesperson said in a statement to CNN.  “They found a few pieces of common information, standardly found in an online search, and used it as part of their attempted phishing scam,” the spokesperson said. The incident is under investigation, according to Fort Lauderdale police. “We would like to take this time to remind our community to exercise caution when fulfilling payment requests and to stay vigilant and aware of potential scams,” the police department added.",

    "content": "Former food company executive Michelle Janavs was sentenced Tuesday to five months in prison for paying bribes in the college admissions scam, the US Attorney’s Office in Massachusetts said.  Janavs, whose family invented Hot Pockets, paid the scheme’s mastermind, Rick Singer, $100,000 to cheat on two of her daughters’ ACTs, and agreed to pay $200,000 to have one of the daughters admitted to University of Southern California as a “fake beach volleyball recruit,” according to a sentencing memorandum.  Janavs, 49, was one of four defendants who are “far and away the most culpable parents” in the admissions scandal,  the memorandum states. Janavs and the three others are “repeat players, who engaged in the conspiracy again and again, over years.” Janavs in October pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. She also was ordered to pay a $250,000 fine and to serve two years of supervised release after prison, said Liz McCarthy, spokesperson for the US Attorney’s Office.  The government had recommended a 21-month sentence for Janavs. John Littrell, her attorney, said the actual sentence “reflects that she’s a profoundly good person.” Janavs understands the consequences of the crime on others, “But this crime does not define who she is,” Littrell told reporters. “Michelle’s gonna be defined by what she’s done the rest of her life, and she has dedicated decades of her life to helping exactly the types of kids who were harmed in this case.” Tuesday’s sentencing was the second in as many days in the enormous admissions scheme that’s resulted in 50 defendants in six states, including actresses, CEOs and university coaches, among others.  On Monday, Michael Center, a former tennis coach at University of Texas at Austin, was sentenced to six months in prison after accepting $100,000 in bribes.  Janavs paid Singer $50,000 in 2017 to cheat on her older daughter’s ACT exam, according to the memorandum. A co-conspirator corrected the daughter’s answers when she took the test at a high school in West Hollywood, California.  In February 2019, Janavs paid Singer $50,000 to cheat on a second daughter’s ACT exam, the memo said.  She also agreed in 2018 to pay $200,000 to get her older daughter into USC as a purported beach volleyball recruit, As part of that agreement, Janavs made a $50,000 payment to the USC Women’s Volleyball from her family’s charitable foundation account, but she was arrested before she made the full payment, according to the US Attorney’s Office.  The other three “most culpable” named in the memorandum are Douglas Hodge, former chief executive officer of Pacific Investment management Company (PIMCO), one of the world’s largest money managers, and Elizabeth and Manuel Henriquez.  Hodge was sentenced to nine months in prison earlier this month for using fraud and bribes to try to get five of his children into exclusive colleges as fake athletic recruits.  Manuel Henriquez, a former Hercules Capital CEO, and his wife, Elizabeth, also “engaged Singer five times to cheat on his two children’s college entrance exams, and an additional time to secure his child’s admission to Georgetown,” according to the memorandum. They have not yet been sentenced.",

    "content": "Scammers claiming to be Wendi Deng Murdoch have swindled thousands of dollars in an elaborate sting involving a fake art project in Indonesia to celebrate the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, victims say.  Photographers Henry Wu and Carley Rudd say they were contacted by someone claiming to be the former wife of media mogul Rupert Murdoch. A screenshot of emails seen by CNN shows “Wendi” then requested a phone call to talk in detail, before offering a job in Indonesia to take photos “capturing the essence of China.” “The person had a really strong presence,” Wu told CNN. “I don’t know how to explain it, it definitely felt that you were talking to someone important.”  Wu and Rudd’s accounts are remarkably similar, with a scammer praising their work and mentioning Pilar Guzman, the then-editor of Conde Nast Travel, as a referral. The US-based photographers were told they would have to pay for flights to Indonesia, which would be reimbursed when the project was complete. The photographers referred to precise details – about their work, dropped hints about Deng’s personal life – that checked out online and seemed to confirm “Wendi’s” authenticity.  “They had the wendimurdoch.com domain, the timing was also legit – we had just finished working on something with Conde Nast,” Wu’s partner Zornitsa Shahanska, who goes by the name Zory Mory online, told CNN. Rudd’s email came from another domain dengmurdoch.com. In one instance the scammer mentioned to Wu that Deng would be unavailable to talk as it was her birthday, which turned out to be accurate, while an email purportedly from the businesswoman to Rudd said that she was in St. Barts, which Rudd corroborated though checking Deng’s Instagram feed.  Money up front After paying thousands of dollars for flights, both Wu and Rudd were told just before leaving the US that they’d need to pay up front for photography permits. With time running out to departure, they agreed – and after landing both handed over cash to a driver who picked them up at the airport. Once on the ground, the scammer concocted roadblocks, such as invented issues with car companies hired to chauffeur them around – and, in Wu’s case, asked for even more money for other permits.  Wu told CNN they had tried to do due diligence but “we overlooked the red flags. I did a DNS (search) on the (wendimurdoch.com) domain, overlooked that it had been registered a couple of weeks previously. It was a combination of we were thinking this would be a great project for us, it would open so many doors, plus, the Conde Nast referral, the timing… I thought they referred us.”  Wu says he and Mory lost about $7,500 through the scheme. He eventually contacted a Jakarta-based friend who said that it was a well-known scam and sent him a link to a Hollywood Reporter story about similar plots using the names of other women in entertainment. Long-running scam K2 Intelligence, a New York-based firm investigating the overall scam, told CNN the fraud has been going on, in a number of forms, since 2013.  Nicoletta Kotsianas, the firm’s director, said the scam targeted creative and media industry professionals, including photographers and Instagram influencers, as well as military veterans who work as bodyguards, stunt men and makeup artists. K2 Intelligence is investigating the Deng Murdoch impersonations under the assumption it is linked to the previous scams. Kotsianas said the firm knew of about 300 people who had been contacted by people impersonating Deng Murdoch or other prominent figures – often high-ranking women – in the media industry. “This is a particularly well-devised scam, they’ve found a way to combine a lot of elements and run with it,” she added.",

    "content": "The US State Department identified a “rapidly growing and troubling trend” of “forced labor as a result of cyber scam operations,” as it launched its annual human trafficking report, US Ambassador at Large to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons Cindy Dyer said Thursday. “Traffickers have leveraged pandemic-related economic hardships, increased global youth unemployment, and international travel restrictions to exploit thousands of adults and children in a multi-billion dollar industry over the last two years in these schemes,” she said at a State Department briefing. Dyer said that “many people have responded to job offers for what they think are legitimate work in it in casinos, or other seemingly legitimate businesses.” “Often these individuals are forced to participate in cyber-scams under impossible quota arrangements that make them increasingly indebted to traffickers. Traffickers use this debt to exploit victims in forced labor and sex trafficking, including in special economic zones, primarily throughout Southeast Asia, but ensnaring nationals from at least 35 countries or territories,” she said. The 2023 report also highlights the fact that men and boys can be victims in trafficking, but may not always be recognized as such and may not get access to the same services. The 2023 report, which covers the period of April 1, 2022 through March 31, 2023, identified which governments around the world are meeting the minimum standards to eliminate human trafficking under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, which have improved or deteriorated, and which have failed in their efforts to combat human trafficking and are not making an effort to do so. Many of the countries in the Tier 3 category for failing to meet the minimum standards to combat human trafficking and “not making significant efforts to do so,” were in that category last year as well. This year’s list has 24 countries in Tier 3, including Russia, China, Afghanistan, Syria, and North Korea. Afghanistan, Burma, China, Cuba, Eritrea, Iran, North Korea, Russia, South Sudan, Syria, and Turkmenistan were listed as having a “‘government policy or pattern’ of human trafficking, human trafficking in government-funded programs, forced labor in government-affiliated medical services or other sectors, sexual slavery in government camps, or the employment or recruitment of child soldiers.”",
